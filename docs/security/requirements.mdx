# Requirements

The requirements in this section are organized hierarchically, with top-level requirements defining
the core rules and obligations that must be met, serving as broad objectives for Bitwarden's
security model. Sub-requirements expand on these by addressing specific scenarios, exceptions, or
clarifications, and may override their parent requirement when explicitly stated. Sibling
requirements at the same level must remain independent and free of contradictions.

## Vault data (VD)

:::warning Draft - Early version

This section is still in its early stages and does not yet reflect current or future standards.

:::

1. Vault data **MUST** be protected _at rest_.

   - a. The Client **MUST** encrypt vault data stored on disk.
   - b. The Client **MUST** use the UserKey to encrypt vault data stored on the Server.
   - c. The Client **SHOULD** ensure that no mechanisms exist such that vault data may be stored to
     disk unencrypted without user consent. This includes cases where it is not the Client itself
     that stores the data to disk.
   - d. The Client **MUST** encrypt any vault data derivatives that can be used to re-create the
     original form or are considered to be vault data on their own.
   - e. The Client **MUST NOT** store any artifacts (e.g. encryption keys) on disk such that the
     encrypted vault data can be decrypted without any additional information provided by the User.
     - i. The Client **MAY** store such artifacts if given an _informed and explicit consent_ by the
       User.
   - f. The Client **MUST NOT** store any artifacts (e.g. encryption keys) such that the vault data
     can be decrypted by the Server, regardless of consent.

2. Vault data **MAY** be unprotected while _in use_.

   - a. The Client **MAY** decrypt all vault data during vault unlock.
     - i. The Client **SHOULD** minimize the quantity of decrypted vault data.
   - b. The Client **MAY** leave vault data encrypted after unlock.
   - c. The Client **MUST** ensure that unprotected data does not linger when no longer _in use_.

3. Vault data **SHOULD** be protected while _in transit_.

   - 1. The Client **MAY** use unprotected transmissions to the display/monitor.
   - 2. The Client **SHOULD** use a trusted channel when the transmission crosses process
        boundaries.
   - 3. The Client **MUST** use a trusted channel if there is a risk that the data can be
        eavesdropped by unintended parties.
   - 4. The Client **MUST** certify that the receiver is within the Bitwarden secure environment.
   - 5. The Client **MUST** use a trusted channel when the transmission crosses device boundaries.

4. Vault data **MUST NOT** be shared without an _informed and explicit consent_ by the User.

   - 1. The Client **MAY** trust the OS to gather consent.
   - 2. The Client **MAY** augment the OS when the consent process is not sufficiently clear or
        explicit.
   - 3. The Client **SHOULD** guarantee that the third party is the receiver.

## Encryption keys (EK)

:::warning Draft - Early version

This section is still in its early stages and does not yet reflect current or future standards.

:::

1. The UserKey **MUST** have 256 bits of security.
2. The UserKey **MUST** be protected _at rest_.
3. The UserKey **MAY** be unprotected while _in use_.
4. The UserKey **MUST** be protected while _in transit_.
5. The UserKey **MUST NOT** be shared.

## Authentication tokens (AT)

:::warning Draft - Early version

This section is still in its early stages and does not yet reflect current or future standards.

:::

1. The authentication tokens MUST be protected at rest if the client provides a mechanism for secure
   storage.

## Secure channels (SC)

:::info Reviewed - Awaiting implementation

This section has been reviewed and is awaiting implementation.

:::

1. A secure channel **MUST NOT** transmit unprotected data.
   - a. Metadata related to the communication protocol **MAY** be transmitted unprotected.
   - b. Metadata related to the communication protocol **MUST** be authenticated.
2. A secure channel **MUST** protect against unauthorized modifications of the data.
3. A secure channel **MUST** protect against replay of messages.
4. A secure channel **MAY** detect loss of data (e.g. dropped messages).
5. A long-lived secure channel **MUST** protect against the decryption of previously transmitted
   data in the event of a future key compromise.
   - a. High-traffic channels **MAY** expose a greater amount of data during key compromise to
     maintain an acceptable user experience.
6. A long-lived secure channel **MUST** recover from key compromise to restore full confidentiality.
   - a. High-traffic channels **MAY** experience a longer recovery period to maintain an acceptable
     user experience.

## Trusted channels (TC)

:::warning Draft - Early version

This section is still in its early stages and does not yet reflect current or future standards.

:::

1. A trusted channel **MUST** also be a secure channel.
2. A trusted channel **MUST** guarantee the receiver(s), including unintended ones.
   - a. The OS **MAY** be trusted to provide this guarantee.
   - b. The User **MAY** be trusted to provide this guarantee (e.g. using fingerprints)
3. A trusted channel **MAY** be partially trusted.
