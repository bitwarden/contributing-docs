# Security

The Security section of this documentation outlines the foundational approach Bitwarden takes to
ensure the safety and integrity of user data. It provides a structured framework for understanding
Bitwarden's security philosophy, the principles it adheres to, and the specific requirements it
implements to meet its commitments.

## Conventions

### Key words

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this section are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

### References

Principles in this documentation are labeled with unique identifiers (e.g., P01, P02, etc.) for easy
reference throughout the document and in related discussions. When referencing a principle, simply
use its identifier (e.g. P01).

Requirements in this documentation use a shorthand format (e.g. XX.N.y) to indicate their specific
location and context (e.g. VD.3.b).

## Structure of the security section

1. **Definitions** This part establishes the foundational terminology used throughout the document.
   By clearly defining key concepts—such as what constitutes "vault data"—it ensures that the rest
   of the document is precise and unambiguous.
2. **Principles** The principles describe the overarching philosophies and commitments that guide
   Bitwarden's approach to security. These principles are not actionable rules but rather serve as
   the justifications for the requirements that follow. They define what Bitwarden aims to achieve
   in its security posture and why certain decisions are made.
3. **Requirements** Building on the principles, the requirements are concrete, actionable steps that
   Bitwarden is required to implement. These requirements ensure that the principles are upheld in
   practice and provide a measurable way to assess Bitwarden's security efforts.

This structure is meant to avoid unnecessary repetition and establish a logical flow from high-level
philosophies to specific actions. It ensures that every requirement is tied to a well-defined
principle, making it clear why it exists and what it is meant to achieve. The document is designed
for both internal stakeholders and external users who seek to understand the company's security
model.
