<dl>
  <dt>Vault data</dt>
  <dd>
    The collection of a user's private information that they choose to store securely within Bitwarden's secure environment.
    This typically includes highly sensitive data such as:

      - **Passwords**: Credentials for various websites, applications, and services.
      - **Usernames**: Associated usernames for accounts.
      - **Secure Notes**: Encrypted notes containing sensitive information that the user wants to keep
        secure.
      - **Credit Card Information**: Payment card details like card number, expiration date, CVV, etc.
      - **Identities**: Personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses
        that can be used to autofill forms.
      - **Attachments**: Any files uploaded by the user to be stored securely within the vault.

    Vault data may also refer to less sensitive data such as metadata:

      - **Last Updated**: The last time an item was updated.
      - **Created Date**: The date an item was created.

  </dd>
  <dt>User</dt>
  <dd>
    An individual who uses Bitwarden to store, manage, and access vault data.
  </dd>
  <dt>Client</dt>
  <dd>
    The software application that the User interacts with to access their vault data. This includes
    the official Bitwarden web vault, desktop applications, mobile applications, browser extensions, and any
    other software provided by Bitwarden that interacts with the Bitwarden server to access or manage vault data.
  </dd>
  <dt>Protected data</dt>
  <dd>
    Data stored in a format that is unreadable without additional information. Usually synonymous to
    encrypted, but with additional expectations about how the key is stored. Encrypted data which is
    stored together with its decryption key in plain text is not considered to be protected, even
    thought it is encrypted.
  </dd>
  <dt>Communication channel</dt>
  <dd>
    A medium through which two or more entities, such as processes,
applications, or systems, exchange data or messages. This can include communication between
components on the same machine, such as inter-process communication (IPC), or over a network, such
as between a client and a server. Common types of communication channels include sockets, APIs,
message queues, shared memory, and HTTP connections.
  </dd>
  <dt>Secure channel</dt>
  <dd>
    A communication channel that provides confidentiality and integrity for the data transmitted
    between two or more parties.

    - **Confidentiality**: The data is unreadable to unauthorized
    parties, typically using encryption.
    - **Integrity**: The data cannot be altered or tampered with
    without detection during transmission.

  </dd>
  <dt>Trusted channel</dt>
  <dd>
    A secure channel that also provides authenticity.

    - **Authenticity**: The identities of the
    communicating parties are verified, ensuring that data is exchanged only between the intended
    parties.

  </dd>
  <dt>Partially trusted channel</dt>
  <dd>
    A communication channel where trust is asymmetrical, meaning only some of the parties trust the
    channel. One party may have verified the other(s) and thus trusts the channel, while the other
    party or parties may not have done so, making the channel trusted by one party but untrusted by
    the other(s).
  </dd>
  <dt>Fully trusted Channel</dt>
  <dd>
    A communication channel where all parties have verified each otherâ€™s identities. This means the
    channel provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, ensuring that the data is secure,
    unaltered, and exchanged only between the trusted parties.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data at rest</dt>
  <dd>
    Any data that is stored on a device or medium that is not actively being used, processed, or
    transmitted. This includes (but is not limited to) data stored on disk on the users devices, or on
    disk on the server side.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data in use</dt>
  <dd>
    Any data that is actively being used, processed or accessed. This includes (but is not limited to) data that is
    temporarily held in volatile memory (like RAM) for quick access, computation, or rendering.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data in transit</dt>
  <dd>
    Data that is actively being transferred from one location to another, such as between memory locations, processes,
    or between devices across a network.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data sharing</dt>
  <dd>
    The controlled process in which data leaves the Bitwarden secure environment unprotected. As a consequence the
    guarantees made by this document will no longer apply. The receiving party may or may not have its own guarantees.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data leaking</dt>
  <dd>
    The process in which data unintentionally leaves the Bitwarden secure environment unprotected.
  </dd>
  <dt>Informed and explicit consent</dt>
  <dd>
    The process by which the User is provided with all relevant information regarding an action, understands it, and
    agrees to the terms in a clear and unmistakable way.

    - **Informed**: The person giving consent must have all necessary information to understand what they are agreeing to.
      All or parts of the information may be assumed to be implicitly provided/understood by the context in which the user
      is giving consent. This includes:
      - **Purpose**: A clear explanation of what the consent is for, such as how their data will be used or what actions will be taken.
      - **Risks and Benefits**: Disclosure of any potential risks, benefits, or consequences associated with their consent.
      - **Alternatives**: Information about any alternatives to consenting and what happens if they choose not to consent.
      - **Rights**: A description of their rights, such as the right to withdraw consent at any time without penalty.
    - **Explicit consent**: Consent must be given clearly and unambiguously, typically through a direct and affirmative action,
      such as clicking "I agree" or a similar action.

  </dd>
  <dt>Certify</dt>
  <dd>Officially recognize (someone or something) as possessing certain qualifications or meeting certain standards.</dd>
  <dt>Bitwarden secure environment</dt>
  <dd>Any process or application that adheres to the "Security" section is treated as "within the Bitwarden secure environment".</dd>
</dl>
