# 01: A locked vault must be and stay protected

Clients must ensure that once the vault has been locked, no vault data can be accessed in plain
text, even if the device becomes compromised after the lock occurs. Protections are not guaranteed
if the device is compromised before the vault is locked.

## Key storage mechanisms must provide adequate protection

Mechanisms used for storing encryption keys when the vault is locked, such as PINs or auto-login,
must provide an appropriate level of security. If encryption keys are stored in less secure
environments (e.g. in the OS's keyring), the associated risks must be carefully considered and
mitigated to ensure that unauthorized access to the vault remains limited, even when convenience
features are used.
