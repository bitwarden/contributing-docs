# P02 - Limited security for vaults on semi-compromised devices

:::info Note

This principle applies only to unlocked vaults. Refer to [P01](./locked-vault-is-secure) for details
on protections for locked vaults.

:::

A semi-compromised device is one where malware exists in User Space but has not breached Kernel or
OS-level protections. On such devices, clients must leverage available protections to prevent
malware from accessing plaintext vault data while the vault is unlocked.

- **Technical controls** (e.g., data compartmentalization or HSMs): Clients should maximize the use
  of Kernel/OS-level protections or other available system mechanisms to safeguard vault data.
- **Administrative controls** (e.g., biometrics, 2FA, approval flows): Clients should balance
  security and usability, avoiding excessive complexity in the user flow.
