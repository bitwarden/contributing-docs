# P01 - A locked vault is secure

Clients must ensure that highly sensitive vault data cannot be accessed in plain text once the vault
has been locked, even if the device becomes compromised after the lock occurs. Protections are not
guaranteed if the device is compromised before the vault is locked.

## Technical Considerations

Achieving this principle depends on the limitations of the platform and environment. For instance,
in environments like JavaScript, where memory management is not fully under the control of the
client, there may be residual plaintext in memory after the vault is locked. While ideal protection
cannot be guaranteed in such cases, efforts must be made to minimize these risks through techniques
such as clearing memory buffers and leveraging platform security features when available.

## Key storage mechanisms must provide adequate protection

Mechanisms used for storing encryption keys when the vault is locked, such as PINs or auto-login,
must provide an appropriate level of security. If encryption keys are stored in less secure
environments (e.g. in the OS's keyring), the associated risks must be carefully considered and
mitigated to ensure that unauthorized access to the vault remains limited, even when convenience
features are used.
