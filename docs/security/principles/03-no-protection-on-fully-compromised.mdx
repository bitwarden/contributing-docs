# P03. No protection on fully compromised systems

:::info Note

This principle applies only to unlocked vaults. Refer to [P01](./locked-vault-protected) for details
on protections for locked vaults.

:::

When hardware or OS-level integrity is fully compromised, vault data may become accessible to
attackers. While Bitwarden continuously strives to provide robust protections, certain threats fall
beyond the reach of software-based security measures.
