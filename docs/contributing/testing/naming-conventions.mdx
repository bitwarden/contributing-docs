# ​Naming Conventions

The main goal of the name is to describe the test in a way that makes it easy to understand what the
test does and which cases it is intending to cover. A good list of test names gives developers the
ability to quickly review that the suite covers all important use cases, and to easily identify gaps
when it does not.

There are many ways of describing a test but what most methods have in common is that they include
the following:

- Unit under test
- State under test
- Expected behavior

We've therefore chosen to use the following format (`[]` means optional)

`<unit> [given <prerequisite>] should <behavior> when <state>`

### Basic example

#### Example 1

- **Unit:** `FormSelectionList.deselectItem`
- **State:** called with a valid id
- **Behavior:** create new copies of the `selectedItems` and `deselectedItems` arrays

#### Example 2

- **Unit:** `FormSelectionList.deselectItem`
- **State:** called with an invalid id
- **Behavior:** do nothing

#### In practice

As you have probably noticed our testing framework `jest` encourages writing tests that start with
`it`, we’ve therefore chosen a convention that follows this pattern. Here is how the examples above
would look like when written using this convention:

```
FormSelectionList
  deselectItem
    ✓ creates new copies of the selectedItems and deselectedItems arrays when called with a valid id
    ✓ does nothing when called with a invalid id
```

In code this would look something like this:

```ts
describe("FormSelectionList", () => {
  describe("deselectItem", () => {
    it("should create new copies of the selectedItems and deselectedItems arrays when called with a valid id", () => {...});
    it("should do nothing when called with an invalid id", () => {...});
  })
})
```

    it("should do nothing when called with an invalid id", () => {...});
  })
})
```

### State arrangement and complex states under test

Sometimes our tests require a lot of code to setup the state, and commonly parts of that code is not
relevant for understanding the tests themselves, e.g. complex constructors for global objects.

#### Duplicated code and utility functions

Most times it is enough to create test utility functions that get rid of the duplicated code and
irrelevant details. Take for example the `createCipher` function in the snippet below:

```ts
describe("VaultFilter", () => {
  describe("filterFunction", () => {

    it("should return true when cipher is deleted and function is filtering for trash", () => {
      const cipher = createCipher({ deletedDate: new Date() });
      const filterFunction = createFilterFunction({ status: "trash" });

      const result = filterFunction(cipher);

      expect(result).toBe(true);
    });

    it("should return false when cipher is deleted and function is filtering for favorites", () => {
      const cipher = createCipher({ deletedDate: new Date() });
      const filterFunction = createFilterFunction({ status: "favorites" });

      const result = filterFunction(cipher);

      expect(result).toBe(false);
    });

  })
})

function createCipher(options: Partial<CipherView> = {}) {
  const cipher = new CipherView();

  cipher.favorite = options.favorite ?? false;
  cipher.deletedDate = options.deletedDate;
  cipher.type = options.type;
  cipher.folderId = options.folderId;
  cipher.collectionIds = options.collectionIds;
  cipher.organizationId = options.organizationId;

  return cipher;
}

function createFilterFunction(...) {...}
```

As you can see the `createCipher` utility function hides a lot of code that would otherwise be
duplicated in both tests.

Notice also how the function allows us hide details that are irrelevant for the behavior we are
trying to verify. The tests make it obvious that the `deletedDate` field is the only field that is
expected to have any effect on the behavior of the unit under test.

#### Shared state and common setup blocks

In certain cases, parts of the state is the same across multiple tests because they all share a set
of common prerequisites. In those cases we can use a `describe` and `beforeEach` block to group
tests together and to setup the common parts of the state that they share. As you may have noticed
the previous snippet is a good example of this, where both tests require a deleted cipher. We can
group these tests together like this (notice the `given` keyword):

```ts
describe("VaultFilter", () => {
  describe("filterFunction", () => {

    describe("given a deleted cipher", () => {
      let cipher;

      beforeEach(() => {
        cipher = createCipher({ deletedDate: new Date() });
      })

      it("should return true when filtering for trash", () => {
        const filterFunction = createFilterFunction({ status: "trash" });

        ...
      });

      it("should return false when filtering for favorites", () => {
        const filterFunction = createFilterFunction({ status: "favorites" });

        ...
      });
    });

  })
})

function createCipher(...) {...}
function createFilterFunction(...) {...}
```

The result would be test names that look like this:

```
VaultFilter
  filterFunction
    given a deleted cipher
      ✓ returns true when filtering for trash
      ✓ returns false when filtering for favorites
```

## Pitfalls

### Verify one behavior

If you find yourself writing long names by stringing together multiple expectations by using the
word _and,_ consider breaking up the test. A test should ideally verify a single behavior
[[4]](https://tddmanifesto.com/a-clean-test/) to make it easier for developers to identify issues
and for reviewers to understand why tests have been modified.

#### Example

- `adds item to selectedItems, removes from deselectedItems, and creates a form control when called with a valid id`

Could instead be written as three different tests

- `adds item to selectedItems when called with a valid id`
- `removes item from deselectedItems when called with a valid id`
- `creates a form control when called with a valid id`

Keep in mind that it is ultimately up to the developers to decide what counts as “verifying a single
behavior” on a case by case basis.

### Include state under test

A common pattern that's easy to fall into is writing test names without taking _state under test_
into account. Take the following examples for an imaginary sorting function:

#### Example without state

- `should return items in alphabetic order`
- `should return empty array`
- `should throw error`

It is not immediately obvious how many behaviors we are actually testing, instead we are grouping
our tests based on the expected output. To understand how the sorting function works and if we have
sufficient coverage we would have to dive into the source code for the test. You might ask questions
such as:

- What happens if I input an array with non-string values? Does it throw an error?
- What could make the function return an empty array?
- What if I input `null`?

If we instead add state into the mix we become forced to split up the tests and properly answer the
questions above:

#### Example when taking state into consideration

- `returns empty array when input is empty`
- `returns empty array when input contains non-string values`
- `returns item when input only contains one item`
- `returns items in alphabetic order when input contains multiple items`
- `throws error when input is not an array`

## Test structure and clean tests

[This section is WIP]

A separate common convention is AAA: Arrange Act Assert.

I think these conventions makes it much easier to read/understand tests while also promoting better
testing
