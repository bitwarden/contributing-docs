# Commit Signing

It's possible to configure git with any name and email, enabling bad actors to spoof commits and
impersonate whomever they want. GitHub supports several ways to digitally sign git commits,
verifying that they came from someone with access to a previously configured private key.

For example, on 3 August 2022, Stephen Lacy
[shared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stephenlacy/status/1554697080718823424) how he uncovered a
massive malware attack on GitHub by noticing unverified commits (i.e. commits that were not
digitally signed).

To protect against commit spoofing, all Bitwarden contributors must digitally sign their commits.
This is optional but encouraged for community contributors.

## Setting up commit signing

Github supports commit signing with GPG, SSH and S/MIME. If you're unsure what to use, we recommend
GPG.

1.  Install GnuPG:

  <Tabs groupId="os">

    <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

    ```bash
    brew install gnupg
    echo "export GPG_TTY=$(tty)" >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

    Restart your open terminal for this to take effect

    </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

2.  Follow the [Github documentation][github-verification] to configure commit signing

3.  Configure your preferred git tool below

4.  Push a test commit to Github and ensure that the "Verified" badge appears next to the commit
    description:

    ![Image showing the Verified badge in Github](./commit-signing.png)

### Command Line

- After configuring commit signing, you can sign a commit by using the `-S` flag:

  ```bash
  git commit -S
  ```

- To avoid using the `-S` flag every time, you can sign all commits by default:

  ```bash
  git config --global commit.gpgSign true
  ```

  (Remove the `--global` flag to only apply this setting to the current repository)

### Visual Studio Code

Enable commit signing in Preferences -> Settings -> search "commit signing".

#### macOS: GPG Key Passphrase Prompt Issue

Some macOS users have had issues with VS Code and the gpg-agent not prompting for the GPG Key
Passphrase in order to sign commits when using the VS Code git GUI. This is illustrated by VS Code
displaying an error popup message: `Git: gpg failed to sign the data`.

A [workaround](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/43809#issuecomment-828773909) for this
issue is to configure your gpg-agent to use
[pinentry](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/pinentry/index.html) for macOS in order to force a
secure prompt. Run the following in a terminal of your choice:

1. `brew install pinentry-mac`
2. `echo "pinentry-program $(which pinentry-mac)" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`
3. `killall gpg-agent`

**Note**: Note: you might have to restart VS Code for this to take effect, but you should now be
prompted for your GPG Key Passphrase as needed. If this does not solve your issue, please follow the
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) guide below.

### SourceTree

Refer to
[Setup GPG to sign commits within SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/sourcetreekb/setup-gpg-to-sign-commits-within-sourcetree-765397791.html).

## Troubleshooting

- If you receive the error message "error: gpg failed to sign the data", make sure you added
  `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` to your `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` if you're using bash) and restarted
  your terminal. Refer to
  [this troubleshooting document](https://gist.github.com/paolocarrasco/18ca8fe6e63490ae1be23e84a7039374)
  for more help with this error
- If you have already committed your changes and forgot to configure gpg signing you can fix it by
  doing a rebase like the following targeting the hash of the previous commit to the one you did (it
  will sign all commits from there):

  ```bash
  git rebase --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -n -S' -i <previous-commmit-hash>
  ```

  Beware that if you had already pushed your changes to origin, you are going to have to do a force
  push in git after applying the fix which shouldn't be harmful on side branches but one needs to
  pay attention just in case.
