# Commit Signing

It's possible to configure git with any name and email, enabling bad actors to spoof commits and
impersonate whomever they want. GitHub supports several ways to digitally sign git commits,
verifying that they came from someone with access to a previously configured private key.

For example, on 3 August 2022, Stephen Lacy
[shared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stephenlacy/status/1554697080718823424) how he uncovered a
massive malware attack on GitHub by noticing unverified commits (i.e. commits that were not
digitally signed).

To protect against commit spoofing, all Bitwarden contributors are encouraged to digitally sign
their commits.

## Setting up commit signing

Github supports commit signing with GPG, SSH and S/MIME. If you're unsure what to use, we recommend
SSH.

1.  Follow the [Github documentation][github-verification] to configure commit signing

2.  Configure your preferred git tool below

3.  Push a test commit to Github and ensure that the "Verified" badge appears next to the commit
    description:

:::tip

We recommend you create a new commit signing key instead of reusing your Github authentication key,
and that you protect the key with a strong passphrase or password.

```bash
EMAIL=your.commit.email@example.com
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/bw-signing -C "$EMAIL" -t ed25519
git.config --global user.email "$EMAIL"
git config --global gpg.format=ssh
git config --global user.signingkey=~/.ssh/bw-signing.pub
```

(Remove the `--global` flags to only apply this setting to the current repository) :::

### Command Line

- After configuring commit signing, you can sign a commit by using the `-S` flag:

  ```bash
  git commit -S
  ```

- To avoid using the `-S` flag every time, you can sign all commits and tags by default:

  ```bash
  git config --global commit.gpgSign true
  git config --global tag.gpgSign true
  ```

  (Remove the `--global` flag to only apply this setting to the current repository)

### Visual Studio Code

Enable commit signing in Preferences -> Settings -> search "commit signing".

#### macOS: GPG Key Passphrase Prompt Issue

Some macOS users have had issues with VS Code and the gpg-agent not prompting for the GPG Key
Passphrase in order to sign commits when using the VS Code git GUI. This is illustrated by VS Code
displaying an error popup message: `Git: gpg failed to sign the data`.

A [workaround](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/43809#issuecomment-828773909) for this
issue is to configure your gpg-agent to use
[pinentry](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/pinentry/index.html) for macOS in order to force a
secure prompt. Run the following in a terminal of your choice:

1. `brew install pinentry-mac`
2. `echo "pinentry-program $(which pinentry-mac)" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`
3. `killall gpg-agent`

**Note**: Note: you might have to restart VS Code for this to take effect, but you should now be
prompted for your GPG Key Passphrase as needed. If this does not solve your issue, please follow the
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) guide below.

### SourceTree

Refer to
[Setup GPG to sign commits within SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/sourcetreekb/setup-gpg-to-sign-commits-within-sourcetree-765397791.html).

## Troubleshooting

- If you receive the error message "error: gpg failed to sign the data", make sure you added
  `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` to your `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` if you're using bash) and restarted
  your terminal. Refer to
  [this troubleshooting document](https://gist.github.com/paolocarrasco/18ca8fe6e63490ae1be23e84a7039374)
