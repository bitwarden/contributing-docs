## Localization (l10n)

We use a translation tool called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) to help manage our localization
efforts across many different languages.

For consistent translations across all platforms and languages, visit
[bitwarden.com/translate](https://bitwarden.com/translate) to learn how to use the localization
glossary.

If you are interested in helping translate the Bitwarden applications into another language (or make
a translation correction), please register an account at Crowdin and join our projects here:

on Crowdin, join the project, and [contact the project owner](https://crowdin.com/profile/dwbit).

## Security policy

Bitwarden believes that working with security researchers across the globe is crucial to keeping our
users safe. If you believe you've found a security issue in our product or service, we encourage you
to please submit a report through our [HackerOne Program](https://hackerone.com/bitwarden/). We
welcome working with you to resolve the issue promptly. Thanks in advance!

### Disclosure Policy

- Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every
  effort to quickly resolve the issue.
- Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or
  a third-party. We may publicly disclose the issue before resolving it, if appropriate.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or
  degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the
  account holder.
- If you would like to encrypt your report, please use the PGP key with long ID
  `0xDE6887086F892325FEC04CC0D847525B6931381F` (available in the public keyserver pool).

While researching, we'd like to ask you to refrain from:

- Denial of service
- Spamming
- Social engineering (including phishing) of Bitwarden staff or contractors
- Any physical attempts against Bitwarden property or data centers

### We want to help you!

If you have something that you feel is close to exploitation, or if you'd like some information
regarding the internal API, or generally have any questions regarding the app that would help in
your efforts, please contact us at <https://bitwarden.com/contact> and ask for that information. As
stated above, Bitwarden wants to help you find issues, and is more than willing to help.

Thank you for helping keep Bitwarden and our users safe!
