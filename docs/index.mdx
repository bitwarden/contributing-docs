## Getting Started

It's likely the first thing you'll need to do is set up a local development environment; to do so,
we recommend progressing through the documentation in the following order.

1. Install all the recommended [Tools and Libraries](./docs/tools/index.md) for development.
2. Follow the [Server Setup Guide](./docs/server/guide.mdx) to setup your local server and related
   services
3. Build and run each [Clients](./docs/clients/index.md) from source and connect them to your local
   server
4. Read our [Contributing Guidelines](./contributing/index.md) and
   [Coding Style](./contributing/code-style/index.md)

## Help make this documentation better

We want a culture of shared knowledge, and documentation is one of the best ways to do that.

- If you have trouble following some instructions, please improve them.
- If you add or change a feature that requires setup for development, please update the
  documentation.
- If you're reviewing a PR that requires a change to this documentation, ask the author to do that
  as part of your review.

To contribute to this documentation, clone the [Developer Docs Github repo][repo] and follow the
instructions in the README.

Please follow the following (very brief) style guide:

- Use numbered paragraphs for all instructions or procedures. Start each paragraph with a verb
  (“click”, “type”, “restart”, etc).
- Use code blocks for all commands. Don't write them in-line.
- Avoid long paragraphs - this documentation should be to-the-point and instructional.
