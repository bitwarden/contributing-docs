## Getting Started

It's likely the first thing you'll need to do is set up a local development environment; to do so,
we recommend progressing through the documentation in the following order.

1. Install all the recommended [Tools and Libraries](./getting-started/tools/index.md) for
   development.
2. Follow the [Server Setup Guide](./getting-started/server/guide.md) to setup your local server and
   related services
3. Build and run each [Clients](./getting-started/clients/index.md) from source and connect them to
   your local server
4. Read our [Contributing Guidelines](./contributing/index.md) and
   [Coding Style](./contributing/code-style/index.md)
