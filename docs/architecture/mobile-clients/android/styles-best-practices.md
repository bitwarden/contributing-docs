# Code Style Guidelines

## Contents

The following outlines the general code style and best practices for Android development. It is
expected that all developers are familiar with the code style documents referenced here and have
them bookmarked for quick reference when necessary.

Rather than repeating the rules listed in those documents, this guide only mentions rules that
**override** or are **in addition to** the ones present in them. Also note that while the
[bitwarden-style.xml](https://github.com/bitwarden/android/blob/main/docs/bitwarden-style.xml)
formatter and the [static code analysis tool](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) will enforce many of
the rules (such as the 100 character line limit) there are many it can not or will not enforce and
it is therefore extremely important that all developers **read and follow this document.** For more
details on what the formatter _does_ handle, refer directly to the settings in Android Studio under
`Preferences > Editor > Code Style` and select the language of interest.

## Kotlin code style

The library's Kotlin code style adheres closely to both the
[code style documentation for the Kotlin language itself](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html)
and the
[code style documentation for the Android Open Source Project](https://android.github.io/kotlin-guides/style.html).
The former provides the "base" reference while the AOSP docs should be viewed as tweaks to that
document. In the rare cases where the two documents disagree, the AOSP rules should apply.

### Disagreements between the Kotlin language and Android code style documents

Some notable disagreements between the two documents include:

- AOSP rules do not allow for two-letter acronyms to be capitalized separately when part of a member
  name. For example

  ```kotlin
  // Bad
  val fetcher: IDFetcher

  // Good
  val fetcher: IdFetcher
  ```

### Custom library style

In general, the code style documents referenced above cover most of the basic cases of interest.
There will always be situations, however, where the documents are unclear, vague, or simply do not
offer an opinion. Furthermore, there are some cases where we will directly break with the code style
documents. Below are some examples of these cases (though it should be noted that no single document
can ever fully classify our complete style and existing code should always be sought for a reference
in questionable cases.)

#### Class and file layout

The documents specify that a class layout should use the following order:

```
- Property declarations and initializer blocks
- Secondary constructors
- Method declarations
- Companion object
```

We will adhere to this order, but there are a few additions / modifications :

- Nested class definitions should be placed _after_ the Companion object. In cases where the nested
  class is only used internally, it is also valid to simply place the class in the same file after
  the main source class.
- The code style documents say to use "logical ordering" for method declarations. We will adhere to
  this principle while also noting that does not mean new code in a file should simply be added to
  the end; be thoughtful about placement! In the absence of any compelling logistical ordering,
  alphabetization is a valid choice (though not required).

  Also please note the following:

  - Methods with certain "special modifiers" (`override`, `operator`, `abstact`, etc.) should come
    first and methods with the same modifiers should be grouped together. Certain types of
    annotations may also qualify as a "special modifier" (refer to existing library code).
  - If any kind of method group described above requires "sub-groups", these can be denoted by the
    use of the `//region <Name> ... //endregion <Name>` markers. These regions should be used for a
    very small set of methods, such as for the overrides to a single interface.

#### Type omission

We generally prefer to omit types whenever the compiler allows it **and** the return type is
_unambiguous_. This is true for functions, properties, and variable declarations.

```kotlin
// Good: This is clearly an integer value.
val durationInSeconds = 100
```

```kotlin
// Bad: The return type can only be inferred by looking at the signature of another function, which
// might itself be omitting a type.
fun requestData() = apiService.getData()
```

When omitting a type for a function, it is very important that it is done _thoughtfully_; a
function's type should not be the _accidental consequence_ of overly concise code.

#### Expression functions

We generally prefer using expression functions whenever possible to keep the code concise and free
of unnecessary boilerplate. This should only be done when a call chain naturally suggests such a
form, though; complicated functions should not be forced into a single expression simply to take
advantage of this feature.

#### Functions as parameters

We strongly encourage the direct use of functions as parameters rather than defining one-off
listener classes. For example

```kotlin
// Good
fun waitForEvent(handler: (Event) -> Unit) {
    val event = produceEvent()
    handler(event)
}
```

is preferable to

```kotlin
interface EventHandler {
    fun handleEvent(event: Event): Unit
}

...

// Bad
fun waitForEvent(handler: EventHandler) {
    val event = produceEvent()
    handler.handleEvent(event)
}
```

This not only reduces the amount of boilerplate code necessary, but it also ensures lambdas can be
used properly from within Kotlin. When an interface is preferred for some reason, strongly consider
the user of [functional interfaces](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/fun-interfaces.html) to continue to
take advantage of SAM conversions at the call site.

#### Long function calls

As discussed
[in the code style document](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#method-calls) long
function calls should place each argument on their own line. The closing parenthesis should be on
its own line as well:

```kotlin
drawSquare(
    x = 10,
    y = 10,
    width = 100,
    height = 100,
    fill = true,
)
```

Unlike those rules, however, we don't allow grouping "multiple closely related arguments on the same
line".

When there is only one argument but the function call must wrap to multiple lines, that argument
should still be placed on its own line(s).

```kotlin
// Good
.register(
    object : Callback<DeviceEvent>() {
        override fun onSuccess() = ...
        override fun onError() = ...
    }
 )
```

```kotlin
// Bad
.register(object : Callback() {
    override fun onSuccess() = ...
    override fun onError() = ...
})
```

#### Annotation-related formatting

When annotating properties, the annotations should be on their own lines and there must be a space
between each annotated property. The following is correct:

```kotlin
// Good
@Inject
val propertyA: PropertyA

@Inject
val propertyB: PropertyB

@Inject
@CustomAnnotation
val propertyC: PropertyC

@Inject
val propertyD: PropertyD
```

while this is not:

```kotlin
// Bad
@Inject val propertyA: PropertyA
@Inject val propertyB: PropertyB
@Inject @CustomAnnotation
val propertyC: PropertyC
@Inject val propertyD: PropertyD
```

#### Chained call formatting

As mentioned in the main documents, for long call chains it is preferred to put all method calls on
their own lines, even the first:

```kotlin
val anchor = owner
    ?.firstChild!!
    .siblings(forward = true)
    .dropWhile { it is PsiComment || it is PsiWhiteSpace }
```

The goal should always be to keep the start of function calls and the closing parenthesis vertically
aligned. Consider the following example:

```kotlin
// Good
fragmentComponent
    .customFragmentComponent(
        CustomFragmentModule(
            this,
            argument,
        )
    )
    .inject(this)
```

Notice what happens if the first method call to `.customFragmentComponent` is placed on the first
line:

```kotlin
// Bad
fragmentComponent.customFragmentComponent(
    CustomFragmentModule(
        this,
        argument,
    )
)
    .inject(this)
```

The closing parenthesis for `.customFragmentComponent()` does not align with either it nor with
`.inject`.

Note that in cases where a single method is being called, it is valid for it to be on the same line
as the instance:

```kotlin
// Good
return Bundle().apply {
    putParcelable(KEY_ARGUMENTS, arguments)
}
```

If a chain is created here, however, the method must be moved down:

```kotlin
// Good
return Bundle()
    .apply {
        putParcelable(KEY_ARGUMENTS, arguments)
    }
    .also { ... }
```

Failure to do so will result in the following incorrect formatting:

```kotlin
// Bad
return Bundle().apply {
    putParcelable(KEY_ARGUMENTS, arguments)
}
    .also { ... }
```

In some cases proper formatting will be impossible. Each of the following---while not ideal---is in
the "correct" format because there is no good alternative:

```kotlin
// Acceptable (no better alternative)
topLevelFunction(
    ...long argument list...
)
    .apply { ... }
```

```kotlin
// Acceptable (no better alternative)
ObjectConstructor(
    ...long argument list...
)
    .apply { ... }
```

These types of scenarios should be avoided when possible (as described above) but are allowed when
necessary.

#### Miscellaneous code formatting

Whenever questions about code formatting arise in which multiple options are valid according to all
previously described rules,
[the Rectangle Rule](https://github.com/google/google-java-format/wiki/The-Rectangle-Rule) is a good
test to use to prefer one style over the other.

#### Documentation

All public classes, functions, and properties should include documentation in the
[KDoc style](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-doc.html). Private classes, functions, and
properties may optionally be documented as needed.

##### Class documentation

Classes with more than 2 constructor properties should document each individually using the
`@property` label; otherwise the property descriptions can be incorporated into the class
description:

```kotlin
// Good. The class contains a single constructor property that is included in the class's own
// documentation

/**
 * A wrapper class for a unique idenfitier, [id].
 */
data class IdWrapper(
    val id: String,
)
```

```kotlin
// Good. The class contains more than two properties and each are documented separately.

/**
 * A class containing various data.
 *
 * @property id The unique identifier for the data.
 * @property name The name of the data.
 * @property value The value associated with the data.
 */
data class Data(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val value: String,
)
```

```kotlin
// Bad. The constructor properties are not documented.

/**
 * A class containing various data.
 */
data class Data(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val value: String,
)
```

```kotlin
// Bad. The constructor properties are not documented individually.

/**
 * A class containing various data ([id], [name], [value]).
 */
data class Data(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val value: String,
)
```

```kotlin
// Bad. Not using KDoc style.

// A class containing various data ([id], [name], [value]).
data class Data(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val value: String,
)
```

##### Functions

Functions are typically allowed to include documentation for parameters within the body of the
function documentation itself independent of their number:

```kotlin
// Good

/**
 * Gets the data for the given [id].
 */
fun getData(id: String): Data
```

```kotlin
// Good

/**
 * Gets a list of data items from the [startDateInMillis] to the [endDateInMillis]. This number of
 * items in the list will not exceed [maxCount].
 */
fun getDataList(
    startDateInMillis: Long,
    endDateInMillis: Long,
    maxCount: Long
): List<Data>
```

```kotlin
// Bad. Not in KDoc style.

// Gets the data for the given [id].
fun getData(id: String): Data
```

When each parameter appears to require more focused documentation, `@param` may be used;

```kotlin
// Good

/**
 * Gets a list of data items.
 *
 * @param startDateInMillis The beginning data (in epoch time as milliseconds) to begin searching
 * for data items.
 * @param endDateInMillis The end data (in epoch time as milliseconds) to stop searching
 * for data items.
 * @param maxCount The maximum number of items to return.
 */
fun getDataList(
    startDateInMillis: Long,
    endDateInMillis: Long,
    maxCount: Long
): List<Data>
```

#### Inline comments

Inline comments are encouraged, particularly when the logic being described is not self-explanatory.
The comments should:

- begin with `//`.
- include a space before the first word.
- capitalize the first word.
- optionally include punctuation for sentence fragments or single sentences.
- include punctuation for multiple sentences.
- prefer the "imperative" voice.

```kotlin
// Good

// Get the data from the database
val data = databaseDataSource.getData(id)
```

```kotlin
// Good

// Get the data from the database. This will happen synchronously.
val data = databaseDataSource.getData(id)
```

```kotlin
// OK. Not in the imperative voice.

// Gets the data from the database
val data = databaseDataSource.getData(id)
```

```kotlin
// Bad. Missing space before first word and missing capitalization on first word.

//get the data from the database
val data = databaseDataSource.getData(id)
```

```kotlin
// Bad. Missing punctuation for multiple sentences.

// Get the data from the database
// This will happen synchronously
val data = databaseDataSource.getData(id)
```

### ViewModels

- Private functions that handle actions should be prefixed with "handle" and suffixed with the name
  of the action. (ex: `handleSubmitClick`)

## Best practices

### Kotlin {#best-practices--kotlin}

The following contains general tips and best practices that apply for Kotlin code (unless otherwise
specified) that has not already been mentioned in their specific sections above.

- We will be adhering to the 100 character line limit. This will be enforced in most places by the
  auto-formatter.

- Avoid unnecessary `if` / `else` nesting and keep code as left-aligned as possible by using early
  return statements. For example

  ```kotlin
  // Bad
  fun someMethod() {
      if (someCondition) {
          // ...many lines of code...
      } else {
          // Do nothing
      }
  }

  // Bad
  fun someMethod() {
      if (someCondition) {
          // ...many lines of code...
      }
  }

  // Good
  fun someMethod() {
      if (!someCondition) {
          return
      }
      // ...many lines of code...
  }
  ```

  When an early return is not possible because additional code is required to run after the `if`,
  consider moving the `if` to its own method.

  ```kotlin
  // Bad
  fun someMethod() {
      if (someCondition) {
         // ...many lines of code...
      }
      // ...more code...
  }

  // Good
  fun someMethod() {
      internalHelperMethod()
      // ...more code...
  }

  // where...
  fun internalHelperMethod() {
      if (!someCondition) {
          return
      }
      // ...many lines of code...
  }
  ```

- Using an expression like `true == someBoolean` is acceptable only when `someBoolean` is nullable
  (i.e. `Boolean?`) and requires unwrapping:

  ```kotlin
  // Bad
  val nonNullBoolean: Boolean = true
  if (nonNullBoolean == true) ...

  // Good
  val nonNullBoolean: Boolean = true
  if (nonNullBoolean) ...

  // Bad (does not compile)
  val nullableBoolean: Boolean? = true
  if (nullableBoolean) ...

  // Good
  val nullableBoolean: Boolean? = true
  if (nullableBoolean == true) ...
  ```

- Any method or constructor left blank deliberately (such as an unneeded interface method) should be
  formatted as a one-line expression function with the explicit return type of `Unit` :

  ```kotlin
  override fun unusedMethod() = Unit
  ```

- Nullability should be very clearly communicated. In Kotlin, **only objects expected to be null
  should be given nullable types**:

  ```kotlin
  // Bad: Are these all *really* nullable? An network object with an "optional" ID does not make
  // much sense.
  data class NetworkData {
    val id: String?
    val name: String?
    val iconUrl: String?
  }

  // Good: The API docs for this class communicate that "id" and "name" will never be null, so
  // they should not be given nullable types. "iconUrl" is not guaranteed, so it may be made
  // nullable.
  data class NetworkData {
    val id: String
    val name: String
    val iconUrl: String?
  }
  ```

- Whenever possible, pass and return _interfaces_ rather than _implementations_. For example:

  ```kotlin
  // Bad: Why should the method care what type of List is passed to it and why should the caller
  // care what type of List is passed back?
  fun filter(input: ArrayList<String>): ArrayList<String> { ... }

  // Good
  fun filter(input: List<String>): List<String>  { ... }
  ```

- With very few exceptions, static variables should never be used. Their use is typically a symptom
  of a failure to properly declare and pass dependencies from one area of the library to another. It
  is better to explicitly pass the dependencies when possible. When "static" behavior is absolutely
  needed, an injected singleton should be used to provided the data instead:

  ```kotlin
  // Bad: This class should not depend on the static data held by another. Not only does it make
  // it hard to understand what the dependencies are here, this code is potentially unstable and
  // unpredictable and hard to control during tests.
  class NeedsExternalData {
      fun someMethod() {
          val data = SomeOtherClass.staticData
          // ...code requiring Data instance...
      }
  }
  ```

  ```kotlin
  // Good: This class requires a Data object to function properly so it is instantiated with it.
  class NeedsExternalData(
      private val data: Data,
  ) {
      fun someMethod() {
          // ...code requiring Data instance...
      }
  }
  ```

  ```kotlin
  // Good: This class requires a Data object for someMethod to function properly, so it is passed
  // in.
  class NeedsExternalData {
      fun someMethod(data: Data) {
          // ...code requiring Data instance...
      }
  }
  ```

  ```kotlin
  // Good: This class requires a Data object for someMethod to function properly, so we inject
  // an instance of DataProvider.
  class NeedsExternalData @Inject constructor(
      private val dataProvider: DataProvider
  ) {
      fun someMethod() {
           val data = dataProvider.getData()
          // ...code requiring Data instance...
      }
  }
  ```

- Functions should not intentionally throw exceptions! Any function that needs to represent the
  possibility of both a success and an error should either:

  - Return the [Result](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-result/) type.
  - Return a custom sealed class to model the possibilities.
  - Return a nullable value and clearly indicate a `null` represents an empty/failure state of some
    kind.

- When it is absolutely required (such as when dealing with external libraries that throw) exception
  handling should be done _properly_ and _only when necessary_. This means that (except for rare
  cases):

  - Never catch `Exception` generically. Always catch the specific errors that are _known to be
    possible_:

    ```kotlin
    // Bad: What exception is being thrown here and why? Is it something we can fix by trying
    // again or is it unrecoverable?
    try {
        service.makeServiceCall()
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        // ...
    }

    // Good
    try {
        service.makeServiceCall()
    } catch (e: RemoteException) {
        // ...
    }
    ```

  - Never catch a `RuntimeException` that _can't happen_:

    ```kotlin
    // Bad: A NumberFormatException is not possible here based on what we know about the value
    // we're using, so we're adding code that isn't necessary.
    val definitelyANumber = "1234"
    val value = try {
        Integer.parseInt(definitelyANumber)
    } catch (e: NumberFormatException) {
        // ...
    }
    ```

    ```kotlin
    // Good
    val definitelyANumber = "1234"
    val value = Integer.parseInt(definitlyANumber)
    ```

  - Never use `e.printStackTrace()`. Instead, use a configurable logging class:

    ```kotlin
    // Bad: This will print directly to the system, even in production.
    try {
        service.makeServiceCall()
    } catch (e: RemoteException) {
        e.printStackTrace()
    }
    ```

    ```kotlin
    // Good
    try {
        service.makeServiceCall()
    } catch (e: RemoteException) {
        Timber.e(e, "Error making a service call.")
    }
    ```

  - Never catch exceptions to "solve" bugs that should be managed elsewhere.

    ```kotlin
    // Bad: Why does the method throw the NPE? Is it our fault or a problem in the method itself?
    // It is impossible to tell here.
    val locationID = methodReturningNullableString()
    try {
        methodRequiringNonNullArguments(locationId)
    } catch (e: NullPointerException) {
        return
    }
    ```

    ```kotlin
    // Good
    val locationId = methodReturningNullableString()
    if (locationId == null) {
        return
    }
    methodRequiringNonNullArguments(locationId)
    ```

  - Never wrap huge chunks of code in a `try` / `catch`; only wrap the lines that throw an
    `Exception`:

    ```kotlin
    // Bad: It is difficult to follow the flow here. Which lines throw? At what point in the
    // code might we be forced to the catch block?
    try {
        val value = lineThatThrows()
        // ...many more lines of code...
    } catch (e: RemoteException) {
        // ...
    }
    ```

    ```kotlin
    // Good
    val value = try {
        lineThatThrows()
    } catch (e: RemoteException) {
        // ...handle the error case...
        return
    }
    // ...many more lines of code...
    ```

    When multiple lines throw the same exception, they may all be placed in the same `try` block:

    ```kotlin
    val value1: String
    val value2: String
    val value3: String
    try {
        value1 = lineThatThrows1()
        value2 = lineThatThrows2()
        value3 = lineThatThrows3()
    } catch (e: RemoteException) {
        // ...
    }
    ```

    When there is code between them that does _not_ throw, then each call should be wrapped
    separately:

    ```kotlin
    val value1 = try {
        lineThatThrows1()
    } catch (e: RemoteException) {
        // ...
    }
    // ...code that does not throw...
    val value2 = try {
        lineThatThrows2()
    } catch (e: RemoteException) {
        // ...
    }
    // ...code that does not throw...
    val value3 = try {
        lineThatThrows3()
    } catch (e: RemoteException) {
        // ...
    }
    ```

### Jetpack Compose {#best-practices--jetpack-compose}

When writing UI layer code using Jetpack Compose, the
[Compose API guidelines](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-api-guidelines.md)
should be considered the go-to reference for style and best practices.

Special consideration should be taken to avoid unnecessary recompositions. There are now numerous
sources that address the topic, including the following:

- https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/performance/bestpractices
- https://getstream.io/blog/jetpack-compose-guidelines/
