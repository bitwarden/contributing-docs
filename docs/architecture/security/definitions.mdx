# Definitions

As a security product features can often be tweaked or adjusted in the name of "security". This is a
very broad term, with unclear meaning, sometimes leading to constantly shifting goals. Further, when
communicating to another engineer, or to product about an intended feature, its implementation and
constraints, the communicating parties may have a different view of what they assume an attacker to
be able to do, and what they want to achieve, possibly even not having anything they want to
achieve, just the notion of "I want a secure product".

A formal approach here is needed: to aid in communication and to also provide a clear set of goals
to achieve. This applies both to ad-hoc conversations in which the participants don't yet share a
common understanding of security goals and the assumed attacker, but it also applies to
long-standing assumed security we want to achieve for our clients, communication protocols, and
cryptography. This is not limited to cryptographic topics.

The security definitions introduced here are based on those in the book
[Introduction to Modern Cryptography](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003398134/introduction-modern-cryptography-yehuda-lindell-jonathan-katz);
it aims to establish what attacker model is considered and what security goals are hoped to achieve.
The security definitions therefore are made up of two parts:

## Threat model

Describes the capabilities of an attacker; that is, "what can they do", but not "how can they do
it". It should communicate the capabilities we assume an attacker to have for that specific
scenario. As appropriate, justifying this threat model helps all parties understand why it is
reasonable to assume this. By default, an attacker is assumed to be able to do nothing, and the
threat model adds capabilities. However, sometimes it can be helpful to add restrictive capabilities
e.g. "attacker does not control the client's code", if participants otherwise take this for granted.

| Attacker has read-only control to the traffic to the API server after time T | Attacker cannot inspect TLS payloads with a MITM proxy                                         |

## Security goals

:::note

"If you don't know what you want to achieve, how can you hope to achieve it"

:::

To get from a vague notion of security to a set of goals we can measure, and possibly provably
achieve, we need to define a clear set of security guarantees. These should describe -- based on the
threat model -- goals we want to provide for a protocol / feature / application component; in other
words, things we don't want an attacker to be able to do.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| An attacker should not be able to gain access to plaintext passwords\*                                                | It should be secure                                      |
| An attacker should not be able to set a client-side key into a state, where they know at least 1 bit of key material  | It should be impossible for an attacker to break the PIN |
| An attacker should not be able to distinguish between a randomly encrypted blob string and a "Credit Card" login item | It should use military grade encryption                  |

_\*There is one underlying assumption always made when talking about security definitions in the
context of Bitwarden's encryption. It is always true that an attacker can gain access to plaintext
passwords if they have the same knowledge and possessions as a user. For instance, an attacker that
guessed a users badly chosen password. We cannot protect against that, therefore we do not consider
it breaking our security definition._

Compared to cryptographic proofs we make some simplifications. We generally omit "with
non-negligible probability" which would usually occur in cryptographic proofs.

## Communication

Instead of a vague notion of security the above two concepts allow formalizing and clearly
communicating the security definitions. Introducing formality and review lets us distinguish
security issues from subjective opinions. Security issues are proven when -- given a threat model --
one can show that a security goal fails.

Updates and additions to security definitions are continuous:

- You come up with a baseline during initial development (shifting left wherever you can).
- You evaluate and revise it when there’s new work on the feature.
- You evaluate and revise it when evaluating each security issue against it.

The definition will change as the system changes. Making this a routine part of vetting those
changes increases the chance that it’ll remain useful.

## Terms

<dl>
  <dt>Vault data</dt>
  <dd>
    The collection of a user's private information that they choose to store securely within Bitwarden's secure environment.
    This typically includes highly sensitive data such as:

      - **Passwords**: Credentials for various websites, applications, and services.
      - **Usernames**: Associated usernames for accounts.
      - **Secure Notes**: Encrypted notes containing sensitive information that the user wants to keep
        secure.
      - **Credit Card Information**: Payment card details like card number, expiration date, CVV, etc.
      - **Identities**: Personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses
        that can be used to autofill forms.
      - **Attachments**: Any files uploaded by the user to be stored securely within the vault.

    Vault data may also refer to less sensitive data such as metadata:

      - **Last Updated**: The last time an item was updated.
      - **Created Date**: The date an item was created.

  </dd>
  <dt>User</dt>
  <dd>
    An individual who uses Bitwarden to store, manage, and access vault data.
  </dd>
  <dt>Client</dt>
  <dd>
    The software application that the User interacts with to access their vault data. This includes
    the official Bitwarden web vault, desktop applications, mobile applications, browser extensions, and any
    other software provided by Bitwarden that interacts with the Bitwarden server to access or manage vault data.
  </dd>
  <dt>Protected data</dt>
  <dd>
    Data stored in a format that is unreadable without additional information. Usually synonymous to
    encrypted, but with additional expectations about how the key is stored. Encrypted data which is
    stored together with its decryption key in plain text is not considered to be protected, even
    though it is encrypted.
  </dd>
  <dt>Communication channel</dt>
  <dd>
    A medium through which two or more entities, such as processes,
applications, or systems, exchange data or messages. This can include communication between
components on the same machine, such as inter-process communication (IPC), or over a network, such
as between a client and a server. Common types of communication channels include sockets, APIs,
message queues, shared memory, and HTTP connections.
  </dd>
  <dt>Secure channel</dt>
  <dd>
    A communication channel that provides confidentiality and integrity for the data transmitted
    between two or more parties.

    - **Confidentiality**: The data is unreadable to unauthorized
    parties, typically using encryption.
    - **Integrity**: The data cannot be tampered with or altered
    without detection during transmission.

  </dd>
  <dt>Trusted channel</dt>
  <dd>
    A secure channel that also provides authenticity.

    - **Authenticity**: The identities of the
    communicating parties are verified, ensuring that data is exchanged only between the intended
    parties.

  </dd>
  <dt>Partially trusted channel</dt>
  <dd>
    A communication channel where trust is asymmetrical, meaning only some of the parties trust the
    channel. One party may have verified the other(s) and thus trusts the channel, while the other
    party or parties may not have done so, making the channel trusted by one party but untrusted by
    the other(s).
  </dd>
  <dt>Fully trusted channel</dt>
  <dd>
    A communication channel where all parties have verified each other's identities. This means the
    channel provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, ensuring that the data is secure,
    unaltered, and exchanged only between the trusted parties.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data at rest</dt>
  <dd>
    Any data that is stored on a device or medium that is not actively being used, processed, or
    transmitted. This includes (but is not limited to) data stored on disk on the user's devices, or on
    disk on the server side.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data in use</dt>
  <dd>
    Any data that is actively being used, processed or accessed. This includes (but is not limited to) data that is
    temporarily held in volatile memory (like RAM) for quick access, computation, or rendering.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data in transit</dt>
  <dd>
    Data that is actively being transferred from one location to another, such as between memory locations, processes,
    or between devices across a network.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data exporting</dt>
  <dd>
    The controlled process in which data leaves the Bitwarden secure environment unprotected. As a consequence the
    guarantees made by this document will no longer apply. The receiving party may or may not have its own guarantees.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data sharing</dt>
  <dd>
    The controlled process in which data is shared with another party within the Bitwarden secure environment.
  </dd>
  <dt>Data leaking</dt>
  <dd>
    The process in which data unintentionally leaves the Bitwarden secure environment unprotected.
  </dd>
  <dt>Informed and explicit consent</dt>
  <dd>
    The process by which the User is provided with all relevant information regarding an action, understands it, and
    agrees to the terms in a clear and unmistakable way.

    - **Informed**: The person giving consent must have all necessary information to understand what they are agreeing to.
      All or parts of the information may be assumed to be implicitly provided/understood by the context in which the user
      is giving consent. This includes:
      - **Purpose**: A clear explanation of what the consent is for, such as how their data will be used or what actions will be taken.
      - **Risks and Benefits**: Disclosure of any potential risks, benefits, or consequences associated with their consent.
      - **Alternatives**: Information about any alternatives to consenting and what happens if they choose not to consent.
