# P03 - No security on fully compromised systems

:::info Note

This principle applies only to unlocked vaults. Refer to [P01](./locked-vault-is-secure) for details
on protections for locked vaults.

:::info Note

Bitwarden does not currently support Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). While TEEs could
potentially provide a secure processing space for vault data on compromised devices, their use is
limited by the environments in which Bitwarden operates. For this reason, TEEs are not considered
when defining what constitutes a fully compromised device.

:::

When hardware or OS-level integrity is fully compromised, vault data may become accessible to
attackers. While Bitwarden continuously strives to provide robust protections, certain threats fall
beyond the reach of software-based security measures.
