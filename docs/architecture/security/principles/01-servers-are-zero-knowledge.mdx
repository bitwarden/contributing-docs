# P01 - Servers are zero knowledge

There is no possibility for an attacker or Bitwarden employee to access your unencrypted data by
compromising Bitwarden's infrastructure. Bitwarden has no ability to decrypt or add to your data.
Your key, which Bitwarden cannot access, is the only thing that can be used to decrypt your data or
create new encrypted data.

More precisely, the special status of providing a network sync for client data does not grant the
server, or any intermediary between the server and client, the ability to reduce the effective
security of the protections that guard a user's data. If a user chooses a weaker form of protection
(e.g., a password instead of a passkey), that is an intentional user decision, but the server must
not be able to manipulate or coerce a client into reducing security beyond what the user knowingly
configures. Additionally, the server or it's infrastructure cannot masquerade it's own plaintext
data as belonging in the set of the user's encrypted data. The total sum of a user's encrypted data
is fully isolated from the server and infrastructure; it cannot be read nor expanded outside of the
user's client context.

This is what we mean when we sometimes refer to "end-to-end encrypted" or "zero knowledge".

## Threat model

- An attacker able to view and/or edit database data
- An attacker able to create, edit, and fully control network responses to a client

Some examples of attackers included in this list could be Bitwarden employees, network
administrators, CDNs, and any MITM that can circumvent TLS protection.

## Security goals

- Attackers cannot retrieve decrypted vault data
- Attackers cannot retrieve user encryption keys
- Attackers cannot inject arbitrary items as vault data
- Attackers cannot edit vault data\*

_\*We do not guarantee availability of vault data in this threat model as attackers have full
control over the database._

## Account key sharing as a feature

This principle does not mean that plaintext data is never shared, but rather that any such exposure
requires informed and explicit consent from the user and is exclusively between accounts, never to
the server or infrastructure.

## Exceptions

On occasion, product features require breaking this principle in a controlled manner. These
exceptions are always a last resort, tightly limited scope, and we are always looking for
improvements to remove them. All exceptions are outlined here.

### Key Connector

Key connector is a self-host only feature that allows an organization user to log in and unlock with
SSO and no password input. This feature is specifically limited to self-hosted instances due to this
principle. It is possible for a Bitwarden server to create an authentication token, contact the Key
Connector server, and retrieve key material that will allow decryption of a user's encrypted data.
For these reasons we encourage strict isolation of key connector servers to private networks and
only to be used by advanced self-hosted users.

### Icons service

The Bitwarden icons service provides site favicons to decorate vault items in the Bitwarden clients.
To enable this functionality, clients need to send plaintext domain name information to the service.
Communicated information is limited to vault item URIs. These URIs are part of a user's encrypted
content, but we do this to speed up loading of vaults, ensure favicons accurately represent the
associated URI, and avoid leaking vault contents to local network administrators. This feature is
easily disabled in client settings.
