# P01 - Servers are not trusted

Clients do not need to trust Bitwarden server or web infrastructure to be good actors to keep an
account's encrypted content secure. In other words, the special status of providing a network sync
for client data does not enable a server, or any entity between the server and client, to take any
action that would aid in decryption of a user's vault by the server.

This is what we mean when we sometimes refer to "End-to-end encrypted."

## Account key sharing as a feature

This principle does not mean that clear text data are never shared, but rather that any such
exposure requires informed and explicit consent from the user and is exclusively between accounts,
never to the server or infrastructure.

## Exceptions

On occasion, product features require breaking this principle in a controlled manner. These
exceptions are always a last resort, tightly limited scope, and we are always looking for
improvements to remove them. All exceptions are outlined here.

### Key Connector

Key connector is a self-host only feature that allows an organization user to log in and unlock with
SSO and no password input. This feature is specifically limited to self-hosted instances due to this
principle. It is possible for a Bitwarden server to create an authentication token, contact the Key
Connector server, and retrieve key material that will allow decryption of a user's vault. For these
reasons we encourage strict isolation of key connector servers to private networks and only to be
used by advanced self-hosted users.

### Icons service

The Bitwarden icons service enables the retrieval of site favicons to decorate vault items in the
Bitwarden clients. To enable this functionality, clients do send clear text domain name information
to the Bitwarden icons service. These URIs are normally encrypted in a vault, but we do this to
aggregate access to the requested domain, speed up loading of vaults, and ensure favicons accurately
represent the associated URI. This feature is easily disabled in client settings.
