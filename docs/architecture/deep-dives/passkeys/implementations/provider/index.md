# Overview

Bitwarden can act as a Passkey Provider to generate and store passkeys for other applications.

## Storage

Passkeys are stored alongside and in the same way as passwords, using the same encryption and
security. This includes both the private key and all related metadata. This data can be stored in
both personal and organization vaults.

Bitwarden only supports the client-side storage modality.
