# Implementations

Bitwarden uses passkeys to provide users with a secure and convenient alternative to passwords. In
this context Bitwarden can act as both a Relying Party (RP) and a Passkey Provider (PP). In other
words: You can use passkeys to log in to Bitwarden, and you can use Bitwarden to generate and store
passkeys for logging into other applications.
