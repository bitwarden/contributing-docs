## What are SSH Keys?

SSH keys are asymmetric key pairs that can be used for signing. Historically, they were intended for
logging into servers, but recently they can also be used for signing arbitrary data, such as git
commits or even regular files. These key pairs consist of a private key, an associated public key and
fingerprint. The latter two can be used to verify a signature created using the private key.

When stored on disk, private keys can be stored in different formats. The modern, widely supported
format is OPENSSH encoding, which supports all of RSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519 keys. Some applications
use the older PKCS#8 format, which is more complex. Further, PKCS#8 Ed25519 keys are not supported
by openssh, so they need to be converted to OPENSSH format before they can be used.

Private keys can be encrypted with a passphrase when stored on disk. The key is derived from the
passphrase using a KDF (bcrypt), and keys can be encrypted using different ciphers (AES-128,
AES-192, AES-256, 3DES). Keys can be used directly by applications, but more commonly they are
loaded and held in an SSH agent. These agents can - after decrypting - hold the keys in memory and
provide signing capabilities. Further, keys can also be stored on hardware tokens like Yubikeys
(`ed25519-sk`).
