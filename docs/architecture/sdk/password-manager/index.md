# Password Manager

The Password Manager SDK is designed for internal use within Bitwarden and supports key
functionality for managing encrypted data, vault access, and user authentication. Written in Rust,
the SDK is versatile and provides bindings for a variety of platforms, including mobile clients
(Kotlin and Swift) and web clients (JavaScript/TypeScript).

This section will provide guidance on developing with the SDK in a way that ensures compatibility
across both mobile and web platforms. It will cover best practices for structuring code, addressing
platform-specific challenges, and ensuring that your implementation works seamlessly across
Bitwardenâ€™s mobile and web applications.
