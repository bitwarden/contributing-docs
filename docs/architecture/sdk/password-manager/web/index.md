The Password Manager SDK supports web-based clients, allowing developers to integrate core password
management functionality into JavaScript/TypeScript environments. The SDK is packaged as an NPM
module under `@bitwarden/sdk-internal` and uses WebAssembly (`wasm`) to enable interaction with Rust
code. This section will provide guidance and best practices for working with the SDK in a browser
environment.
