# 0010 - Angular Modules

<AdrTable frontMatter={frontMatter}></AdrTable>

## Context and Problem Statement

> NgModules are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a
> workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. They can contain components, service
> providers, and other code files whose scope is defined by the containing NgModule. They can import
> functionality that is exported from other NgModules, and export selected functionality for use by
> other NgModules.
>
> -- <cite>https://angular.io/guide/architecture-modules</cite>

In ADR [0002 Define public module in NPM packages](./0002-public-module-npm-packages.md) we decided
to start using barrel files and restrict imports from other "modules". This solves some of the pain
points we have encountered, however all components are still exported in the barrel files since they
need to be defined in an Angular Module. This limits the usefulness of the barrel files.

Angular encourages creating many small NgModules, with people advocating for either one Module per
feature, or going so far as defining one module per component. In Angular v14 this was made easier
with the introduction of [standalone components](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components).

## Considered Options

- **Do nothing** - Maintain the status quo and define most components in a single module. This would
  mean that each component is still essentially global.
- **[Angular Modules](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-modules)** - Add NgModules alongside our
  barrel files. This allows for proper encapsulation of internal components.
- **[Standalone Components](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components)** - provides the
  benefits of NgModules without most of the additional boilerplate. Is still in preview and is
  therefore risky to rely on.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Angular Modules**

### Positive Consequences

- Internal components cannot be re-used outside of the feature.
- Modules are required for supporting lazy loading.
- Similar structure as _Standalone Components_ which will allow for easy migration in the future
  should this be deemed necessary.

### Negative Consequences

- Angular error handling for NgModules is awful and provides cryptic errors that are hard to debug.
- Additional boilerplate.

## Guidelines

- Aim to export as few components as possible. In many cases you don't need to export any components
  at all, and can instead encapsulate the routing within that module which allows for it to be lazy
  loaded should it be deemed useful.
- Functionality that needs to be shared across all modules should be placed in the `Shared` feature.
- Consider creating a `feature/shared` module in case additional functionality needs to be shared
  between modules such as the _Individual Vault_ and _Organization Vault_.

### Implementation

An example of a feature module would be the **reports**. We know that reports are used both for the
individual users and for organizations.

```text
reports
  shared
    report-card.component
    report-list.component

    reports-shared.module.ts
    index.ts
  reports
    breach-report.component
    ...
  reports.module.ts -> depends on reports-shared.module.ts
  reports.component.ts
  index.ts

organizations
  reports
    organization-reports.module.ts -> depends on reports-shared.module.ts
```
