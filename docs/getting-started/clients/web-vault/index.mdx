# Web Vault

## Requirements

- Before you start, you must complete the [Clients repository setup instructions](../index.md).
- If you want to develop against a local server instance, see the
  [Server Setup Guide](../../server/guide.md).

### SSL Certificate

It's recommended to generate a valid SSL certificate for local development rather than using the
shared development cert. This will prevent browser warnings about invalid certificates and properly
support WebAuthn which is blocked on websites with certificate errors. Please follow the
[mkcert installation instructions](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation).

```bash
# Generate and install root CA
mkcert --install

# Generate cert valid for localhost, 127.0.0.1 and bitwarden.test
cd apps/web
mkcert -cert-file dev-server.local.pem -key-file dev-server.local.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 bitwarden.test
```

## Build instructions

:::tip Nx commands are preferred.

We now recommend using Nx commands for building projects. For web:

```bash
# Build and watch (GPL)
npx nx serve web --configuration=oss-dev
# Build and watch (Bitwarden)
npx nx serve web --configuration=commercial-dev
```

For complete Nx documentation and all available commands, see
[Using Nx to Build Projects](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/blob/main/docs/using-nx-to-build-projects.md).

1.  Build and run the Web Vault.

  <Community>

  ```bash
  cd apps/web
  npm run build:oss:watch
  ```

  </Community>

  <Bitwarden>

  ```bash
  cd apps/web
  npm run build:bit:watch
  ```

  </Bitwarden>

    Which will target the local bitwarden instance. See [Official Server](#official-server) for
    information on how to target official servers.

2.  Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8080`. You should see the Bitwarden Log In Screen.

3. If you'd like to take this a bit further, start your local server and have MailCatcher set up. Now let's create an account and verify it.

    - Create a new account. This could be a fake email
    - Log into the new account
    - Click on Verify Email Address
    - Navigate to `http://localhost:1080/`
    - Open the no reply email and verify your email address

You can also run the Web Vault in self-hosted mode by using the `build:bit:selfhost:watch` and
`build:oss:selfhost:watch` commands.

## Configuring API endpoints

By default, the Web Vault will use your local development server (running at `localhost` on the
default ports). You can use the official Bitwarden server instead or configure custom endpoints.

### Official Server

To use the official Bitwarden server, follow the build instructions above, but run the Web Vault
using the following command:

<Community>

```bash
ENV=cloud npm run build:oss:watch
```

</Community>

<Bitwarden>

```bash
ENV=cloud npm run build:bit:watch
```

</Bitwarden>

### Custom Endpoints

You can manually set your API endpoint settings by creating a `config/local.json` file with the
following structure:

```json
{
  "dev": {
    "proxyApi": "<http://your-api-url>",
    "proxyIdentity": "<http://your-identity-url>",
    "proxyEvents": "<http://your-events-url>",
    "proxyNotifications": "<http://your-notifications-url>",
    "allowedHosts": ["hostnames-to-allow-in-webpack"]
  },
  "urls": {}
}
```

- `dev`: Proxies traffic from ex. `/api -> <http://your-api-url>`.
- `urls`: Directly calls the remote service[^1]. **Note:** This can cause issues with CORS headers.

[^1]:
    `urls` adhere to the
    [type definition in `EnvironmentService`](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/blob/main/libs/common/src/platform/abstractions/environment.service.ts).
