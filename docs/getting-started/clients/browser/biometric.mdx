# Biometric Unlock

Currently, Biometric unlock is supported on Mobile, Desktop, and Browser
Extensions[\*](#which-devices-support-biometric-unlock). Bitwarden's biometric unlock is integrated
with native messaging APIs to leverage this functionality.

## Which Devices Support Biometric Unlock?\*

See the [help article](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/biometrics/) for the latest, but as of
this writing, here's the rundown:

_Supported:_

- Chromium Based Browsers
- Firefox Versions 87 and later
- Safari 14 and later
- Side-loaded Windows Desktop App from the [help site](https://bitwarden.com/download)
- Mac Apple Store downloaded Mac App
- Windows Desktop Apps via Windows Hello
- Linux Desktop via Polkit

_Not Supported:_

- Firefox Versions 86 and earlier
- Side-loaded macOS Desktop Apps

## General Setup Steps

:::caution

If you've installed a locally built browser extension for Safari in the past, reset your extension
reference paths as described [here](./index.md).

:::

Native messaging works by having the browser start a lightweight proxy baked into our desktop
application.

Out of the box, the desktop application can only communicate with the production browser extension.
When you enable browser integration in the desktop application, the application generates manifests
which contain the production IDs of the browser extensions. To enable communication between the
desktop application and development versions of browser extensions, we need to add your browser
extension development ID to this manifest instead.

### Build and Run the Browser Extension

- In the local Browser project, run `npm ci`.
- To use the local browser extension on Safari, use this command: `npm run dist:safari:dmg`. Once
  this has built, you should see the Bitwarden Extension in Safari's Settings under Extensions menu.
  If not, open and build the related Xcode project (usually found in
  `$HOME/browser/dist/Safari/dmg/desktop.xcodeproj`). It should then show up in the Settings
  Extensions menu, and you can enable it.
- For other browsers, use `npm run build:watch` and then load the locally built extension using the
  method described [here](./index.md#testing-and-debugging).

### Add the Extension ID for Native Messaging

Once you have the Extension running, confirm that the Extension ID has been added to the
`NativeMessagingHost` JSON file for your chosen browsers.

- Find the Extension ID at `chrome://extensions` or `about:debugging`.

- Add the ID to the `NativeMessageHost` JSON using your IDE. This file is nested in the
  ApplicationSupport Directory. For example, for the Chrome browser the file is located at:

  <Tabs groupId="os">
    <TabItem value="win" label="Windows" default>
      <CodeBlock language="bash">{`%APPDATA%\\Bitwarden\\browsers\\chrome.json`}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
      <CodeBlock language="bash">
        {`~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.8bit.bitwarden.json`}
      </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">
      <CodeBlock language="bash">
        {`~/.config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.8bit.bitwarden.json`}
      </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

### Build and Run the Desktop App

Follow the [Desktop](../desktop/index.mdx) setup document.

:::caution

On macOS you will either need to build a [Mac App Store Development Build](../desktop/mac/index.md),
or turn off gatekeeper.

:::

I've got the projects running, now what?

- In the Desktop app's Preferences menu, turn on `Enable browser integration`.
- In the Browser Extension, access the Settings menu, and enable the `Unlock with biometrics`
  option.

  - The Browser will ask you to allow the action, but then lock the Extension. When you unlock the
    vault and enable Biometric unlock again, you'll be asked to confirm this choice in the Desktop
    app and also use the native biometric unlock feature.
