# CLI

:::tip

If youâ€™re not familiar with the CLI client, the Bitwarden Help Center has lots of
[great documentation](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/cli/) that will help you get oriented.

:::

## Requirements

Before you start, you must complete the [Clients repository setup instructions](../index.md).

## Build Instructions

Build and run:

<Bitwarden>

```bash
cd apps/cli
npm run build:bit:watch
```

</Bitwarden>

<Community>

```bash
cd apps/cli
npm run build:oss:watch
```

</Community>

By default, this will use the official Bitwarden servers. You can target your local server by using
the [config command](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/cli/#config). You may need to
[configure node to use your self-signed certificate](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/cli/#using-self-signed-certificates).

## Testing and Debugging

The build is located at `build/bw.js`. You can run this with node, for example:

```bash
node build/bw.js login
```

It may be more convenient to make the file executable first:

```bash
cd build
chmod +x bw.js
./bw.js login
```

To debug the CLI client, run it from a
[Javascript Debug Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_javascript-debug-terminal)
and place the breakpoints in your Typescript code.
