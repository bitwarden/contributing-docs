## Build native module

The desktop application relies on a native module written in rust, which needs to be compiled
separately. This is baked in to the build process for `npm run electron`, but you can also compile
it manually.

```bash
cd apps/desktop/desktop_native
npm run build
```

**Note**: This module needs to be re-built if the native code has changed.

### Cross compile

In certain environments such as WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), it might be necessary to
cross-compile the native module. To do this, first make sure you have installe the relevant rust target. See
[rustup documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/cross-compilation.html) for more information.

```bash
# Ensure cargo env file is sourced.
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

cd apps/desktop/desktop_native
export PKG_CONFIG_ALL_STATIC=1
export PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1
npm run build -- --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl # Replace with relevant target
```

## Build Instructions

Build and run:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run electron
```

## Debugging and Testing

Electron apps have a renderer process, which runs in the Electron window, and the main process,
which runs in the background.

The renderer process can be inspected using the Chromium debugger. It should open automatically when
the Desktop app opens, or you can open it from the “View” menu.

The main process can be debugged by running the app from a
[Javascript Debug Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_javascript-debug-terminal)
in Visual Studio Code and then placing breakpoints in `build/main.js`.

## Biometric Unlock (Native Messaging)

Instructions for configuring native messaging (communication between the desktop application and
browser extension) are located [in the Browser section](../browser/biometric.mdx).

## Troubleshooting

### Trouble building

If you see an error like this:

```bash
[Main] Error: Cannot find module '@bitwarden/desktop-native-darwin-arm64'
```

You likely haven't built the native module, refer to [Build Native Module](#build-native-module).

### Desktop electron app window doesn't open

If running `npm run electron` throws an error similar to this:

```bash
[Main] npm ERR! Error: Missing script: "build-native"
```

or the electron window doesn't render, you may need to update node and/or npm. Upgrading from older
versions to these solved this issue:

- Node: `16.18.1`
- npm: `8.19.2`
