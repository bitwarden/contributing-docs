:::warning

Entity Framework support is still in beta and is not suitable for production databases.

:::info

This page refers to setting up a Bitwarden instance to develop on, for instructions on testing out
our EF deployments for personal use, such as Bitwarden Unified, please see
[the help documentation](https://bitwarden.com/help/install-and-deploy-unified-beta/).

:::

## Background

Entity Framework (EF) is an ORM framework that acts as a wrapper around a database. It allows us to
support multiple (non-MSSQL) databases without having to maintain migration and query scripts for
each.

Our EF implementations currently support Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite3.

## Creating the database

The workflow here is broadly the same as with the normal MSSQL implementation: set up the Docker
container, configure user secrets, and run migrations against their relating databases in
chronological order.

### Requirements

- A working local development server ([see steps](../../guide.md))
- Docker
- A way to manage user secrets in the server project - see
  [User Secrets](../../../../contributing/user-secrets.md)
- Database management software (see [tools recommendations](../../../tools/index.md#databases))
- The `dotnet` CLI
- The `dotnet` CLI [Entity Framework Core tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet)

You can have multiple databases configured and switch between them by changing the value of the
`globalSettings:databaseProvider` user secret. You don’t have to delete your connection strings.

### User secrets

Add the following values to your API, Identity, and Admin user secrets.

<Tabs
    groupId="provider"
    values={providers}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

Be sure to change information like root password as needed. If you already have these secrets, make
sure you update the existing values instead of creating new ones

```json
"globalSettings:databaseProvider": "postgres",
"globalSettings:postgreSql:connectionString": "Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=example;Database=vault_dev;Include Error Detail=true",
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

Be sure to change information like root password as needed. If you already have these secrets, make
sure you update the existing values instead of creating new ones.

```json
"globalSettings:databaseProvider": "mysql",
"globalSettings:mySql:connectionString": "server=localhost;uid=root;pwd=example;database=vault_dev",
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mariadb">

MariaDB is generally a drop-in alternative to MySQL, so it shares the `mysql` configuration keys.

Be sure to change information like root password as needed. If you already have these secrets, make
sure you update the existing values instead of creating new ones.

```json
"globalSettings:databaseProvider": "mysql",
"globalSettings:mySql:connectionString": "server=localhost;uid=root;pwd=example;database=vault_dev",
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sqlite">

Add the following values to your API, Identity, and Admin user secrets. Note, you must set the Data
Source path. Git is configured to ignore `.db` files in the server repository so that the sqlite
database can be stored in `dev`. You can use any path with write permissions.

```json
"globalSettings:databaseProvider": "sqlite",
"globalSettings:sqlite:connectionString": "Data Source=/path/to/your/server/repo/dev/bitwarden.db",
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

After making changes to your `secrets.json` file, remember to run `pwsh setup_secrets.ps1 -clear` so
that the changes take effect.

:::

### Start the database server

<Tabs
    groupId="provider"
    values={providers}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

1. Confirm that `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `dev/.env` matches the password in `dev/secrets.json`.

2. In the `dev` folder of your server repository, run

```bash
docker compose --profile postgres up
```

:::tip[Confirm your database connection!]

If you run into connection errors, double check that your `.env` and `secrets.json` files have
matching passwords. If they do, you may have initialized your database incorrectly. Delete the
Docker storage volume and initialize the database from scratch.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

1. Confirm that `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` in `dev/.env` matches the password in `dev/secrets.json`.

2. In the `dev` folder of your server repository, start your database container:

```bash
docker compose --profile mysql up
```

:::tip[Confirm your database connection!]

If you run into connection errors, double check that your `.env` and `secrets.json` files have
matching passwords. If they do, you may have initialized your database incorrectly. Delete the
Docker storage volume and initialize the database from scratch.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mariadb">

1. Confirm that `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` in `dev/.env` matches the password in `dev/secrets.json`.

2. In the `dev` folder of your server repository, run

```bash
docker compose --profile mariadb up
```

:::tip[Confirm your database connection!]

If you run into connection errors, double check that your `.env` and `secrets.json` files have
matching passwords. If they do, you may have initialized your database incorrectly. Delete the
Docker storage volume and initialize the database from scratch.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sqlite">

No additional step is required for SQLite. The migrator will create the database file if it doesn't
exist.

:::tip[Confirm your database path!]

The migrator does not create folders. If you get an error that the path doesn't exist, double check
that the path exists and that the folder containing the sqlite database has write and/or create
permissions.

:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[Start all containers at once]

Use the `ef` profile to start all EntityFramework database containers at once:

```bash
docker compose --profile ef up
```

:::

### Run migrations

In the `dev` folder, run the following command to update the database to the latest migration:

<Tabs
    groupId="provider"
    values={providers}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -postgres
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -mysql
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mariadb">

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -mariadb
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sqlite">

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -sqlite
```

:::note

The migrator creates the database file if it doesn't exist, but it does not create folders. If you
get an error that the path doesn't exist, it's referring to missing folders.

:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify changes

If you would like to verify that everything worked correctly:

- Check the database tables to make sure everything has been created
- Run the integration tests from the root of your server project using `dotnet test`.
  - Note: this requires a configured MSSQL database. You may also need to set up other EF providers
    for tests to pass.

## Database integration tests

Database integration tests run for each database provider for both Dapper (MSSQL) and Entity
Framework. Developers are not expected to manually test each database provider. Instead, use
integration tests to ensure correctness across all supported databases.

Integration tests have their own connection strings, so that you can use separate databases to the
one used by your local development server. This is recommended because integration tests produce a
lot of test data over time. In the example below, this is done by using `vault_test` as the database
name.

### Configuring test databases

1. In your user secrets, find or add this block of secrets in the root of the json structure
   (**not** in `GlobalSettings`):

```
"databases:0:type": "Postgres",
"databases:0:connectionString": "Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=_________;Database=vault_test",
"databases:0:enabled": "true",
"databases:1:type": "Sqlite",
"databases:1:enabled": "true",
"databases:1:connectionString": "Data Source=_________",
"databases:2:type": "MySql",
"databases:2:connectionString": "server=localhost;uid=root;pwd=_________;database=vault_test",
"databases:2:enabled": "true",
"databases:3:type": "SqlServer",
"databases:3:connectionString": "Server=localhost;Database=vault_test;User Id=SA;Password=_________;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;",
"databases:3:enabled": "true"
"databases:4:type": "MySql",
"databases:4:connectionString": "server=localhost;port=4306;uid=maria;pwd=_________;database=vault_test;AllowUserVariables=true",
"databases:4:enabled": "true",
```

:::note

The second MySql entry refers to MariaDB.

:::

:::info

The example database index + type combinations are required for the tooling to work, and to support
multiple versions of the same database running tests at the same time.

:::

This block is used for test databases for each supported provider type. These are what integration
tests will connect to. Make sure that you fill in the password for each connection string.

2. Run `pwsh setup_secrets.ps1 -clear` to apply the updated user secrets to your local projects.

3. Ensure your databases are all migrated (see instructions above). You can use the `-test` flag to
   only migrate the integration test databases, or `-all` to migrate everything.

   ```
   # Migrate a specific integration test database (used by tests)
   pwsh migrate.ps1 -postgres -test

   # Migrate a specific development database (used by your local server)
   pwsh migrate.ps1 -postgres

   # Migrate all local databases
   pwsh migrate.ps1 -all
   ```

4. Run integration tests from the `test/Infrastructure.IntegrationTest` folder using `dotnet test`.
