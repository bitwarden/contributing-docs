:::warning

Entity Framework support is still in beta and is not suitable for production databases.

:::info

This page refers to setting up a Bitwarden instance to develop on, for instructions on testing out
our EF deployments for personal use, such as Bitwarden Unified, please see
[the help documentation](https://bitwarden.com/help/install-and-deploy-unified-beta/).

:::

## Background

Entity Framework (EF) is an ORM framework that acts as a wrapper around a database. It allows us to
support multiple (non-MSSQL) databases without having to maintain migration and query scripts for
each.

Our EF implementations currently support Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite3.

## Creating the database

The workflow here is broadly the same as with the normal MSSQL implementation: set up the Docker
container, configure user secrets, and run migrations against their relating databases in
chronological order.

### Requirements

- A working local development server
- Docker
- A way to manage user secrets in the server project - see
  [User Secrets](../../../../contributing/user-secrets.md)
- Database management software (see [tools recommendations](../../../tools/index.md#databases))
- The `dotnet` CLI
- The `dotnet` CLI [Entity Framework Core tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet)

You can have multiple databases configured and switch between them by changing the value of the
`globalSettings:databaseProvider` user secret. You donâ€™t have to delete your connection strings.

### User secrets

Add the following values to your API, Identity, and Admin user secrets.

<Tabs
    groupId="provider"
    values={providers}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

Be sure to change information like root password as needed. If you already have these secrets, make
sure you update the existing values instead of creating new ones

```json
"globalSettings:databaseProvider": "postgres",
"globalSettings:postgreSql:connectionString": "Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=example;Database=vault_dev;Include Error Detail=true",
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

Be sure to change information like root password as needed. If you already have these secrets, make
sure you update the existing values instead of creating new ones

```json
"globalSettings:databaseProvider": "mysql",
"globalSettings:mySql:connectionString": "server=localhost;uid=root;pwd=example;database=vault_dev",
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sqlite">

Add the following values to your API, Identity, and Admin user secrets. Note, you must set the Data
Source path. Use the file location selected in [Database Setup](#database-setup)

```json
"globalSettings:databaseProvider": "sqlite",
"globalSettings:sqlite:connectionString": "Data Source=/path/to/your/server/repo/dev/bitwarden.db",
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

After making changes to your `secrets.json` file, remember to run `pwsh setup_secrets.ps1 -clear` so
that the changes take effect.

:::

### Updating the database

<Tabs
    groupId="provider"
    values={providers}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

1. Confirm that `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `dev/.env` matches the password in `dev/secrets.json`.

2. In the `dev` folder of your server repository, run

```bash
docker compose --profile postgres up
```

:::tip[Confirm your database connection!]

If you run into connection errors, double check that your `.env` and `secrets.json` files have
matching passwords. If they do, you may have initialized your database incorrectly. Delete the
Docker storage volume and initialize the database from scratch.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

1. Confirm that `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` in `dev/.env` matches the password in `dev/secrets.json`.

2. In the `dev` folder of your server repository, run

```bash
docker compose --profile mysql up
```

:::tip[Confirm your database connection!]

If you run into connection errors, double check that your `.env` and `secrets.json` files have
matching passwords. If they do, you may have initialized your database incorrectly. Delete the
Docker storage volume and initialize the database from scratch.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sqlite">

Select a location for your database file. You can use the `dev` folder of your server repository.
Git is configured to ignore `.db` files in this repository for this purpose.

:::tip[Confirm your database path!]

The migrator creates the database file if it doesn't exist, but it does not create folders. If you
get an error that the path doesn't exist, double check that the path exists and that the folder
containing the sqlite database has write and/or create permissions.

:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Migrations

<Tabs
    groupId="provider"
    values={providers}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

In the `dev` folder run the following to update the database to the latest migration

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -postgres
```

The `-postgres` flag on `migrate.ps1` runs `dotnet ef` commands to perform the migrations.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

In the `dev` folder run the following to update the database to the latest migration

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -mysql
```

The `-mysql` flag on `migrate.ps1` runs `dotnet ef` commands to perform the migrations.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sqlite">

In the `dev` folder run the following to update the database to the latest migration

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -sqlite
```

The `-sqlite` flag on `migrate.ps1` runs `dotnet ef` commands to perform the migrations.

:::note

The migrator creates the database file if it doesn't exist, but it does not create folders. If you
get an error that the path doesn't exist, it's referring to missing folders.

:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also run migrations for all database providers at once using

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -all
```

### Verifying changes

If you would like to verify that everything worked correctly:

- Check the database tables to make sure everything has been created
- Run the integration tests from the root of your server project using `dotnet test`.
  - Note: this requires a configured MSSQL database. You may also need to set up other EF providers
    for tests to pass.

## Testing changes

In your `server/dev/secrets.json` file find or add this block of secrets in the root of the json
structure:

```
"databases:0:type": "Postgres",
"databases:0:connectionString": "Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=_________;Database=ef_test",
"databases:0:enabled": "true",
"databases:1:type": "Sqlite",
"databases:1:enabled": "true",
"databases:1:connectionString": "Data Source=_________",
"databases:2:type": "MySql",
"databases:2:connectionString": "server=localhost;uid=root;pwd=_________;database=ef_test",
"databases:2:enabled": "true",
"databases:3:type": "SqlServer",
"databases:3:connectionString": "Server=localhost;Database=ef_test;User Id=SA;Password=_________;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;",
"databases:3:enabled": "true"
```

:::info

The example database index + type combinations are required for the tooling to work, and to support
multiple versions of the same database running tests at the same time.

:::

This block is used for test databases for each supported provider type. These are what integration
tests will connect to. You should update the password for these connection strings to match your
existing databases if you have not already. If these settings are not present at all in your
`server/dev/secrets.json` file just add them to the bottom. These settings _do not_ go in
`globalSettings`. Then run `pwsh setup_secrets.ps1 -clear` to apply them to your local projects.

With connection strings applied to your projects: ensure your databases are all migrated using
`pwsh server/dev/migrate.ps1 --all`. Then you can run EF tests from the
`test/Infrastructure.IntegrationTest` folder using `dotnet test`.

## Modifying the database

The process for modifying the database is described in
[Migrations](./../../../../contributing/database-migrations/ef.md).
