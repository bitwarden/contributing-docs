:::warning

Entity Framework support is still in beta and is not suitable for production databases.

:::info

This page refers to setting up a Bitwarden instance to develop on, for instructions on testing out
our EF deployments for personal use, such as Bitwarden Unified, please see
[the help documentation](https://bitwarden.com/help/install-and-deploy-unified-beta/).

:::

## Background

Entity Framework (EF) is an ORM framework that acts as a wrapper around a database. It allows us to
support multiple (non-MSSQL) databases without having to maintain migration and query scripts for
each.

Our EF implementations currently support Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite3.

## Setting Up EF Databases

The workflow here is broadly the same as with the normal MSSQL implementation: set up the docker
container, configure user secrets, and run migrations against their relating databases in
chronological order.

### Requirements

- A working local development server
- Docker
- A way to manage user secrets in the server project - see
  [User Secrets](../../../../contributing/user-secrets.md)
- Database management software (see [tools recommendations](../../../tools/index.md#databases))
- The `dotnet` CLI
- The `dotnet` CLI [Entity Framework Core tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet)

You can have multiple databases configured and switch between them by changing the value of the
`globalSettings:databaseProvider` user secret. You donâ€™t have to delete your connection strings.

### Database Setup

<Tabs
    groupId="provider"
    values={providers}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

In the `dev` folder of your server repository, run

```bash
docker compose --profile postgres up
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

In the `dev` folder of your server repository, run

```bash
docker compose --profile mysql up
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sqlite">

Select a location for your database file. You can use the `dev` folder of your server repository,
git is configured to ignore `.db` files in this repository for this purpose.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### User secrets

Add the following values to your API, Identity, and Admin user secrets.

<Tabs
    groupId="provider"
    values={providers}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

Be sure to change information like root password as needed. If you already have these secrets, make
sure you update the existing values instead of creating new ones

```json
"globalSettings:databaseProvider": "postgres",
"globalSettings:postgreSql:connectionString": "Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=example;Database=vault_dev;Include Error Detail=true",
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

Be sure to change information like root password as needed. If you already have these secrets, make
sure you update the existing values instead of creating new ones

```json
"globalSettings:databaseProvider": "mysql",
"globalSettings:mySql:connectionString": "server=localhost;uid=root;pwd=example;database=vault_dev",
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sqlite">

Add the following values to your API, Identity, and Admin user secrets. Note, you must set the Data
Source path. Use the file location selected in [Database Setup](#database-setup)

```json
"globalSettings:databaseProvider": "sqlite",
"globalSettings:sqlite:connectionString": "Data Source=/path/to/your/server/repo/dev/db/bitwarden.db",
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

After making changes to your `secrets.json` file, remember to run `pwsh setup_secrets.ps1 -clear` so
that the changes take effect.

:::

### Migrations

<Tabs
    groupId="provider"
    values={providers}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

In the `dev` folder run the following to update the database to the latest migration

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -postgres
```

The `-postgres` flag on `migrate.ps1` will run `dotnet ef` commands to perform the migrations.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

In the `dev` folder run the following to update the database to the latest migration

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -mysql
```

The `-mysql` flag on `migrate.ps1` will run `dotnet ef` commands to perform the migrations.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sqlite">

In the `dev` folder run the following to update the database to the latest migration

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -sqlite
```

The `-sqlite` flag on `migrate.ps1` will run `dotnet ef` commands to perform the migrations.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also run migrations for all database providers at once using

```bash
pwsh migrate.ps1 -all
```

### Optional: Verify

If you would like to verify that everything worked correctly:

- Check the database tables to make sure everything has been created
- Run the integration tests from the root of your server project using `dotnet test`.
  - Note: this requires a configured MSSQL database. You may also need to set up other EF providers
    for tests to pass.

## Testing EF Changes

Since we allow for multiple databases it is important that any changes to EF repositories/models are
tested against all possible databases. You may want to use a database that is different from your
local development database because the tests may add or remove data. To apply migrations to a
database different from your global settings run the following commands from the root of your
repository

```bash
# EntityFramework CLI Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet

# Migrate Postgres database ex connection string: Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=SET_A_PASSWORD_HERE_123;Database=vault_dev_test
dotnet ef database update --startup-project util/PostgresMigrations --connection "[POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING]"

# Migrate MySql database ex connection string: server=localhost;uid=root;pwd=SET_A_PASSWORD_HERE_123;database=vault_dev_test
dotnet ef database update --startup-project util/MySqlMigrations --connection "[MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING]"

cd test/Infrastructure.IntegrationTest

# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows#secret-manager
dotnet user-secrets set "Ef:Postgres" "[POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING]"
dotnet user-secrets set "Ef:MySql" "[MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING]"

# You can also set the connection string for your normal development MS SQL database like below
dotnet user-secrets set "Dapper:SqlServer" "[MSSQL_CONNECTION_STRING]"
```

You can then run just those tests from the `test/Infrastructure.IntegrationTest` folder using
`dotnet test`.
