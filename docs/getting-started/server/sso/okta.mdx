# Okta

This guide will set up basic SSO auth using Okta. This is for testing ONLY and should not be linked
to any production environment.

Prerequisites:

1.  Bitwarden server setup and configured.
2.  Access to Development collection in your Bitwarden Vault

## Steps

Start the following server projects:

- Identity
- API
- SSO (located at `server/bitwarden_license/src/Sso`)

In your browser do the following steps to access Okta.

1.  Launch the "[oktapreview.com](http://oktapreview.com)" login item in the Development collection.
    Log in using those credentials
2.  Expand the "Directory" section on the left menu panel
3.  Click "People"
4.  Click "Add Person" and create a profile for yourself. Use the same email as your local Bitwarden
    user and set a password and click "Save"
5.  Click "Applications" in the top menu bar
6.  You should now see a list of our test apps. For the purpose of local testing, click the
    "Bitwarden Test 2" application. The Client Credentials and other information for this
    application will be listed, which you can use in the subsequent steps. You will need to
    reference information on both the "General" and "Sign On" tabs on the Application screen.

Open a separate browser tab to configure SSO in your local Bitwarden web vault.

1.  Log into your web vault and navigate to the organization you want to enable SSO for
2.  Click `Settings` for the organization and enter an Identifier. This should be unique - it can
    just be the organization name. Click Save.
3.  Go to `Manage > Single Sign-On` and input the following information:

| Type                               | OpenId Connect                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Authority                          | https://dev-836655.oktapreview.com |
| Client ID                          | Copy from Okta                     |
| Client Secret                      | Copy from Okta                     |
| OIDCS Redirect Behaviour           | Redirect GET                       |
| Get Claims From User Info Endpoint | :white_check_mark:                 |

You can now log in using SSO.

:::note

You must have your vault URL set in your client endpoints
