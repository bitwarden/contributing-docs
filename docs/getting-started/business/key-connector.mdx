# Key Connector

:::info

If you're new to Key Connector, you should read the [Help Center documentation][help] first to
understand how it works.

:::

## Requirements

<Bitwarden>

- A [local development server](../server/guide.md), running in the
  [self-hosted configuration](../server/self-hosted/index.mdx)
- An enterprise organization with [Single Sign-On](../server/sso/index.md) configured

</Bitwarden>

<Community>

- A [local development server](../server/guide.md) running in the self-hosted configuration
- An enterprise organization with SSO configured

</Community>

- [Web vault](../clients/web-vault) running locally
- [.NET Core 5.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)

### macOS

macOS requires updated SSL libraries, otherwise you will receive the error "No usable version of
libssl was found".

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="intel" label="Intel" default>

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. Install the OpenSSL package:
   ```bash
   brew install openssl
   ```
3. Set the required environment variables to point to the OpenSSL libraries:
   ```bash
   echo 'DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```
4. If you are running the Key Connector from a terminal, restart your terminal to make sure the
   updated `.zshrc` settings are applied

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="arm" label="ARM">

Given that the Key Connector project is based on NET 5 then we need to use the x86_64 version of
OpenSSL, thus installing x86_64 packages using Homebrew (a guide with several approaches can be
found
[here](https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/installing-intel-based-packages-using-homebrew-on-the-m1-mac/)).

1. Install Rosetta
   ```bash
   softwareupdate --install-rosetta
   ```
2. Set your terminal to Open using Rosetta (create a duplicate of the terminal application -> Go to
   Get Info -> check Open using Rosetta).
3. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

   3.a This should gives us a Homebrew living in `/usr/local` but if it doesn't work prepend
   `arch -x86_64` before the Homebrew installation command.

4. Install the OpenSSL package using the x86_64 Homebrew:
   ```bash
   arch -x86_64 /usr/local/homebrew/bin/brew install openssl
   ```
5. Set the required environment variables to point to the OpenSSL libraries:
   ```bash
   echo 'export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```
6. If you are running the Key Connector from a terminal, restart your terminal to make sure the
   updated `.zshrc` settings are applied or run
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setup and configuration

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bitwarden/key-connector.git
   ```

### Configure keys and user secrets

:::caution

These are recommended development settings and are not suitable for production use. More
configuration options are available in the
[README](https://github.com/bitwarden/key-connector/blob/master/README.md) if required.

:::

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `dev` folder inside your local Key Connector repository

2. Generate a new RSA keypair (these will be ignored by git provided they are in the `dev` folder):

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -keyout bwkc.key -out bwkc.crt -subj "/CN=Bitwarden Key Connector" -days 36500

   openssl pkcs12 -export -out ./bwkc.pfx -inkey bwkc.key -in bwkc.crt -passout pass:{Password}
   ```

3. Create your own copy of the example user secrets:

   ```bash
   cp secrets.json.example secrets.json
   ```

4. Edit `secrets.json` and insert the missing information, including the path to your local
   repository and a password for your database file.
5. (Optional) By default, Key Connector will use the local self-hosted endpoints -
   `https://localhost:8081` for the web vault and `http://localhost:33657` for Identity. No changes
   are required if you're following this documentation. However, if you need different endpoints for
   your setup, you can set them in your user secrets as follows:

   ```json
   "keyConnectorSettings": {
     "webVaultUri": "https://localhost:8081",
     "identityServerUri": "http://localhost:33657"
   }
   ```

6. Save and apply the user secrets:

   ```bash
   pwsh setup_secrets.ps1
   ```

:::info

If you need help setting user secrets, see the
[User Secrets Reference](../../contributing/user-secrets.md).

:::

### Configure organization

1. Open your local web vault and configure your enterprise organization to use the following
   settings:

   - Policies: Single Organization and Single Sign-On Authentication

   - Single Sign-On:

     - Member Decryption Option: Key Connector

     - Key Connector URL: `http://localhost:5000`

## Running and Debugging

You're now ready to start using Key Connector in your dev environment!

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="vs" label="Visual Studio" default>

Open the solution file (`bitwarden-key-connector.sln`) with Visual Studio and click the "Play"
button.

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/KeyConnector --configuration Development
```

:::note

If running on ARM based Mac you may need to use `/usr/local/share/dotnet/x64/dotnet`

```bash
/usr/local/share/dotnet/x64/dotnet run --project src/KeyConnector --configuration Development
```

:::

The `--configuration` flag is required for macOS to use the right SSL libraries.

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After starting Key Connector, log in with SSO using an account that is not an Admin or an Owner. New
users will be onboarded to Key Connector automatically, and existing users will be prompted to
remove their Master Password.
