# Splunk app

The Bitwarden Splunk app fetches event log data from the Bitwarden Public API and makes it available
in Splunk.

## Requirements

- Docker. If you're using an Apple Silicon Mac, enable _Docker Desktop_ -> _Settings_ -> _General_
  -> _Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon_
- Python 3.7 - 3.10
- [Poetry][poetry]
- libmagic (macOS only), available via homebrew: `brew install libmagic`
- A Bitwarden Teams or Enterprise organization
- If using a local development server - make sure the Events and EventsProcessor projects are
  running and [Event Logging](../server/events.md) is working

## Set up and configuration

### Configure your environment

1. Clone the Github repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bitwarden/splunk.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the root of the repository:

   ```
   cd splunk
   ```

3. Tell poetry to use the required Python version:

   ```
   poetry env use <executable>
   ```

   Where `<executable>` is the executable for Python. If this is in your PATH variable then you do
   not need to specify the full path. e.g. `poetry env use python3.8`

4. Activate the poetry shell:

   ```
   poetry shell
   ```

5. Install dependencies:

   ```
   poetry install --with dev
   ```

### Set up Splunk Enterprise

1. Run Splunk Enterprise:

   ```
   docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 --name splunk -d -p 8001:8000 -p 8089:8089 -e SPLUNK_START_ARGS='--accept-license' -e SPLUNK_PASSWORD='password' splunk/splunk:latest
   ```

   Please note this will set the admin password to `password`. This is for development purposes
   only.

2. Confirm that Splunk is running by navigating to http://localhost:8001

### Deploy the app

1. Package the app:

   ```
   ./package.sh
   ```

   This will produce a packaged Splunk app in `output/bitwarden_event_logs.tar.gz`

2. Deploy the app to Splunk:

   ```
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

   This will restart Splunk and it may take a few seconds to become available again after the script
   is finished

3. (optional) Check the logs for errors or for debugging purposes later:
   ```
   docker exec -u splunk -it splunk tail -f /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/bitwarden_event_logs_beta.log
   ```

### Configure the app in Splunk

1. Navigate to the Splunk web app: http://localhost:8001

2. Log in with the username `admin` and the password `password`

3. Click on the _Apps_ -> _Bitwarden Event Logs_

4. Complete the setup. Refer to the [Bitwarden Help Center][Bitwarden Splunk SIEM] for more
   information about configuration

You should now see your organization events in _Apps_ -> _Bitwarden Event Logs_ -> _Dashboards_.
