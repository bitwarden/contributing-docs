# Directory Connector

The Bitwarden Directory Connector is a a desktop application used to sync your Bitwarden enterprise
organization to an existing directory of users and groups.

Directory Connector receives fewer updates than the main clients. To reduce maintenance costs, it
has its own copy of our shared Javascript libraries (formerly known as jslib), located in the
`jslib` subdirectory.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 (LTS)

- Windows users: To compile the native node modules used in the app you will need the Visual C++
  toolset, available through the standard Visual Studio installer (recommended) or by installing
  `windows-build-tools` through `npm`. See more at
  [Compiling native Addon modules](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#compiling-native-addon-modules).

# Build Instructions

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bitwarden/directory-connector.git
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd directory-connector
    npm ci
    ```

3.  Run the app:

    <Tabs>

    <TabItem value="gui" label="GUI" default>

    ```bash
    npm run electron
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

    ```bash
    npm run build:cli:watch
    ```

    You can then run commands from the `./build-cli` folder:

    ```bash
    cd ./build-cli

    node ./bwdc.js --help

    # Test sync
    node ./bwdc.js test

    # Real sync
    node bwdc.js sync
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

## Syncing from a directory service

To properly test Directory Connector, you'll need a directory to sync. We have instructions for
setting up:

- an [Open LDAP Docker image](./open-ldap.md) (recommended)

- [JumpCloud](./jumpcloud.md)

These are both LDAP directory services. If you need to test another type, you should be able to find
a platform offering a free tier of that service.

If you need to test Active Directory (not Azure AD), contact the Integration Engineering team for
remote access to a test AD instance.
