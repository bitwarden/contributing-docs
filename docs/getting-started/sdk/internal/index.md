# Internal SDK

Bitwarden clients rely on a core SDK, built in Rust, for shared functionality between our
applications.

Documentation on how to begin development in the internal SDK can be found in the project's
[`README`](https://github.com/bitwarden/sdk-internal).

For an understanding of the overall design philosophy and structure please review the
[SDK Architecture](../../../architecture/sdk).
