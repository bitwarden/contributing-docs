# Kubernetes

The Bitwarden Secrets Manager Kubernetes Operator (`sm-operator`) is a tool for teams to integrate
Bitwarden Secrets Manager into their Kubernetes workflows seamlessly.

The sm-operator uses a
[controller](https://github.com/bitwarden/sm-kubernetes/blob/main/internal/controller/bitwardensecret_controller.go)
to synchronize Bitwarden Secrets into Kubernetes secrets. It does so by registering a Custom
Resource Definition of BitwardenSecret into the cluster. It will listen for new BitwardenSecrets
registered on the cluster and then synchronize on a configurable interval.

:::info

If you're new to Secrets Manager, you should read the
[Help Center documentation](https://bitwarden.com/help/secrets-manager-overview/) first to
understand how it works.

:::

## Requirements

:::info

Most of the required setup can be handled using Visual Studio Code Dev Containers. That is the
recommended approach, especially for macOS and Windows users.

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dev-container" label="Dev Container" default>

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

:::caution

The Dev Container will not work correctly if you are using a container engine other than Docker.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="direct" label="Direct Setup">

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code Go Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go)
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) version 1.21
- [musl-gcc](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/getting-started.html)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) or another container engine
- A [Kind Cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) or other Kubernetes cluster with
  Kubectl pointed to it as the current context for local development.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You will also need:

- A
  [Bitwarden organization with Secrets Manager](https://bitwarden.com/help/sign-up-for-secrets-manager/).
  You will need the organization ID GUID for your organization.
- An [access token](https://bitwarden.com/help/access-tokens/) for a Secrets Manager machine account
  (previously known as service account) tied to the projects you want to pull.

## Setup and configuration

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitwarden/sm-kubernetes.git
```

Open Visual Studio Code at the repository root.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dev-container" label="Dev Container" default>

Dev Container setup is automated. This will create a Kind cluster and setup all necessary software.

- Open the command palette (using `Cmd/Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` or `F1` depending on user settings)
- Start typing `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="direct" label="Direct Setup">

:::info

Please note that the Visual Studio Code debugger for Go does not work correctly if you open your
workspace via a symlink anywhere in the path. For debugging to work, you should open it from the
full path of the repository.

:::

- Install all requirements listed in the Direct Setup requirements
- Create a Kind cluster using `kind create cluster`
- Run `make setup` to create a default .env file.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configuration settings

A `.env` file will be created in the repository root once the Dev Container is created or
`make setup` has been run. The following environment variable settings can be updated to change the
behavior of the operator:

- **BW_API_URL** - Sets the Bitwarden API URL that the Secrets Manager SDK uses. This is useful for
  self-host scenarios, as well as hitting European servers.
- **BW_IDENTITY_API_URL** - Sets the Bitwarden Identity service URL that the Secrets Manager SDK
  uses. This is useful for self-host scenarios, as well as hitting European servers.
- **BW_SECRETS_MANAGER_STATE_PATH** - Sets the base path where Secrets Manager SDK stores its state
  files.
- **BW_SECRETS_MANAGER_REFRESH_INTERVAL** - Specifies the refresh interval in seconds for syncing
  secrets between Secrets Manager and K8s secrets. The minimum value is 180.

## Running and debugging

1. Install the Custom Resource Definition into the cluster using `make install` or by using the
   Visual Studio Task called "apply-crd" from the "Tasks: Run Task" in the command palette.

2. To debug the code, just hit F5. You can also use `make run` at the command line to run without
   debugging.

:::info

You can also run this (without a debugger) in one step by running: `make install run`

:::

### Uninstall Custom Resource Definition

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

:::info

Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

:::

### Create a BitwardenSecret to test

With the debugger running, we now will create a BitwardenSecret object to synchronize Secret Manager
secrets into a K8s secret:

:::caution

Creating the authorization token secret below via kubectl will place your authorization token in the
machine terminal history. For production systems, consider using a CSI secrets driver or applying
the secret via an ephemeral build agent.

:::

:::info

Make sure to run the following commands in the Dev Container terminal in VS Code.

:::

1. Create a secret to house the Secrets Manager authentication token in the namespace where you will
   be creating your BitwardenSecret object:
   `kubectl create secret generic bw-auth-token -n <some-namespace> --from-literal=token="<Auth-Token-Here>"`

:::info

To get a list of namespaces, run `kubectl get namespaces`

:::

2. Install an instance of BitwardenSecret. An example can be found in
   [config/samples/k8s_v1_bitwardensecret.yaml](https://github.com/bitwarden/sm-kubernetes/blob/main/config/samples/k8s_v1_bitwardensecret.yaml).
   You will want to copy this example and update it for your own needs. Then apply it like so:
   `kubectl apply -n <some-namespace> -f k8s_v1_bitwardensecret.yaml`

3. In the Debug Console window, you should see messages stating that the secret started and
   completed synchronization.

4. Run the following to view if the secret was created: `kubectl get secrets -n <some-namespace>`

5. Run the following to view the structure and data of the synchronized secret:
   `kubectl get secret -n <some-namespace> <secret-name> -o yaml`

:::info

The secret values are stored as Base64 encoded strings.

:::

#### BitwardenSecret manifest

Think of the BitwardenSecret object as the synchronization settings that will be used by the
operator to create and synchronize a Kubernetes secret. This Kubernetes secret will live inside of a
namespace and will be injected with the data available to a Secrets Manager machine account
(previously known as service account). The resulting Kubernetes secret will include all secrets that
a specific machine account has access to. The sample file
([config/samples/k8s_v1_bitwardensecret.yaml](https://github.com/bitwarden/sm-kubernetes/blob/main/config/samples/k8s_v1_bitwardensecret.yaml))
provides the basic structure of a BitwardenSecret manifest. The key settings that you will want to
update are listed below:

- **metadata.name**: The name of the BitwardenSecret object you are deploying
- **spec.organizationId**: The Bitwarden organization ID you are pulling Secrets Manager data from
- **spec.secretName**: The name of the Kubernetes secret that will be created and injected with
  Secrets Manager data.
- **spec.authToken**: The name of a secret inside of the Kubernetes namespace that the
  BitwardenSecrets object is being deployed into that contains the Secrets Manager machine account
  authorization token being used to access secrets.

Secrets Manager does not guarantee unique secret names across projects, so by default secrets will
be created with the Secrets Manager secret UUID used as the key. To make your generated secret
easier to use, you can create a map of Bitwarden Secret IDs to Kubernetes secret keys. The generated
secret will replace the Bitwarden Secret IDs with the mapped friendly name you provide. Below are
the map settings available:

- **bwSecretId**: This is the UUID of the secret in Secrets Manager. This can found under the secret
  name in the Secrets Manager web portal or by using the
  [Bitwarden Secrets Manager CLI](https://github.com/bitwarden/sdk-sm/releases).
- **secretKeyName**: The resulting key inside the Kubernetes secret that replaces the UUID

Note that the custom mapping is made available on the generated secret for informational purposes in
the `k8s.bitwarden.com/custom-map` annotation.

## Testing the Docker image

Kind on Windows has a difficult time pulling from a local registry, so we have provided two
different routes for deploying the image.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="registry" label="With Registry" default>

1. Build and push your image to a registry location (local or otherwise) specified by `IMG`:
   `make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/sm-operator:tag`

2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:
   `make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/sm-operator:tag`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kind-push" label="Push to Kind">

1. Build and push your image directly to Kind by using the Visual Studio Code Command Palette. Open
   the palette (F1) and select Tasks: Run Task and select "docker-build" followed by "kind-push".

2. Deploy the Kubernetes objects to Kind by using the Visual Studio Code Command Palette. Open the
   palette (F1) and select Tasks: Run Task and select "deploy".

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

Custom configuration of URLs, refresh interval, and state path is handled by updating the
environment variables in
[config/manager/manager.yaml](https://github.com/bitwarden/sm-kubernetes/blob/main/config/manager/manager.yaml)
when working with the container.

:::

After install, create your K8s authorization token secret and a BitwardenSecret as described earlier
in this document to test.

### Viewing pod logs

To view the logs of an operator deployed via the steps above:

1. Run `kubectl get pods -n sm-operator-system`. This will retrieve the name of the installed
   operator pod.

2. Run `kubectl logs -n sm-operator-system <name-of-pod-from-previous-step>`

### Undeploy controller

To remove the controller pod installed to the cluster, run:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Unit testing

Unit tests are currently found in the following files:

- internal/controller/suite_test.go

- cmd/suite_test.go

To run the unit tests, run `make test`. To debug the unit tests, open the file you would like to
debug. In the `Run and Debug` tab in Visual Studio Code, change the launch configuration from
"Debug" to "Test current file", and then press F5.

:::info

You will need to run `make test` prior to debugging tests, since this will setup some of the
necessary software for the operator tests.

:::

:::caution

Using the Visual Studio Code "Testing" tab is not currently supported.

:::

## Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions via
[api/v1/bitwardensecret_types.go](https://github.com/bitwarden/sm-kubernetes/blob/main/api/v1/bitwardensecret_types.go),
re-generate the manifests using:

```sh
make manifests
```

[Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)
