# Tools

## Operating System

All Bitwarden developers are issued with a MacBook. The tooling recommendations and instructions in
this documentation assume that you’re using macOS. This may require some adaptation if you’re using
a different operating system.

## Recommended tools

The following tools are strongly recommended as part of the “standard” developer setup. We recommend
that any new Bitwarden developer install all of them as part of setting up their local development
environment.

### IDEs

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - used for all Typescript projects.
  Suboptimal for C#. Be sure to install [extensions](#visual-studio-code-extensions)
- [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) - Pretty good at C# (Server
  and Mobile)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - required for iOS Mobile development and Safari web
  extension

### Local environment

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - package manager for macOS
- [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) (available via Homebrew) - a better terminal emulator
- Various browsers - It’s nice to have a slew of browsers ready to test the extension in a host of
  scenarios. You can also use multiple browsers to have different browser extension version
  installed to compare them.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - required for server development only
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - required for server and other backend
  development environments

  (available via Homebrew: `brew install powershell`)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) v20 (preferably using a [node version manager][nvm])
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) v10 (included with Node)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) latest stable version - (preferably installed via
  [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
